 * Truth-contracts encoded here (NEVER soften these for aesthetics — Wave
 * 9D/9E/9F/9G/9H/9J/9K + W11/W13 +  W2):
 *   - connecting ≠ connected ≠ mining-capable        ()
 *   - pool-target-difficulty ≠ achieved-difficulty   ()
 *   - "lucky" = achieved ≥ 4× pool target            (LUCKY_THRESHOLD = 4)
 *   - staged ≠ written ≠ flashed ≠ booted            (Wave 9D7/9D8/W2)
 *   - scheduled ≠ booted                             (Wave 9D8)
 *   - donation, NOT devfee                           (no license server)
 *   - proxied hashrate is labelled (via bosminer)    (Wave 9D9)
 *   - autotuner never claims convergence w/o evidence (W3 finish)
 *   - cut hash power before raising fan noise         (quiet-home posture)
 *
 * Phase-3 agents: call `glossary('hashrate_local_vs_pool')` to get the text,
