//!  eep-A — EEPROM record DTOs (HAL-free, post-cipher).
//!
//! Source RE evidence:
//! .
//!
//! Bosminer-plus-tuner ships four EEPROM parser variants, each keyed on
//! the first two bytes of the (decrypted) plaintext blob. This module
//! consumes a **plaintext** byte slice (caller has already run XXTEA /
//! AES-128-ECB / Braiinsminer cipher as needed) and decodes the typed
//! record fields above the cipher.
//!
//! The crypto layer lives separately:
//! - EDF v5 / XXTEA caller-key path: `dcent-toolbox::core::eeprom_decoder`
//!   (Python, already shipped as -T2 partial).
//! - x19_plain / x19_J XXTEA: the deployed key and three-region framing are
//!   closed in [`crate::deployed_eeprom`]. This module still keeps its legacy
//!   post-cipher DTO dispatcher separate; callers holding a raw 256-byte page
//!   must use that deployed decoder rather than treating ciphertext as plaintext.
//!
//! Preamble dispatch (per RE doc §2):
//!
//! | Byte 0 | Byte 1   | Variant       | Hashboard families                  |
//! |--------|----------|---------------|-------------------------------------|
//! | `0x04` | `0x11`   | x19_plain/x19_J | BHB42xxx (S19/S19j Pro/T19; BM1398/BM1362) |
//! | `0x05` | `0x11`   | edf_v5_xxtea  | BHB56xxx, BHB68xxx (BM1366/BM1368)  |
//! | `0x01` | `0x41`   | format1_plaintext_name | A3HB4xxxx / A3HB7xxxx (S21 Pro/XP; BM1370) |
//! | `'B'`  | `'r'`    | braiinsminer  | BMM100/BMM101                       |
//! | other  | other    | UnknownPreamble | rejected with parse error         |
//!
//! **Format 1 note (2026-08-02; body decode landed rank 20, 2026-08-04):**
//! A3HB-prefixed boards are format 1, NOT format 5. Their header is `0x01 0x41`,
//! where `0x41` is `board_name[0]` (`'A'`), NOT a key-version selector —
//! `board_name` sits in a 16-byte plaintext header. `dispatch()` now returns a
//! structured, IDENTITY-ONLY [`Format1PlaintextNameRecord`] read from the known
//! plaintext offset `raw[1..16]`; the enciphered body key is unrecovered, so
//! every V/F/sweep/serial/CRC field stays absent (never falls back to a sibling
//! SKU's envelope). Evidence:
//! evidence/epic-eeprom-matched-samples-20.json` (A3HB70501/70601/70701
//! `fmt=1|keyver=65`). **Dispatch is always on `raw[0]`; never map a SKU to a
//! format** (`BHB56801` appears as both format 4 and 5).
//!
//! HAL-free; pure logic. Tests cover synthetic plaintext + the JSON shape
//! verified against `a lab unit` `hb0/hb1/hb2.parsed.json` evidence in the
//! knowledge-base.

/// boards anywhere in any held corpus are BM1370 (the roster's 13 BM1370
/// boards are all `A3HB*`, format 1); and the DCENT-held s21 `BHB68606` page
/// plus the three held format-5 BHB68 pages all carry the BM1368 lot-code
/// letter `'V'` (W5-RANK-13 §2). A catch-all in EITHER direction is a guess:
/// `-> BM1370` mis-labels the likely-BM1368 unknown, `-> BM1368` would
/// mis-label a future genuine BM1370 `BHB68…`. Neither is evidence, so an
/// unknown must be `None` (per-SKU evidence adds a new EXACT row). The

    // UB-26 (2026-08-03): the six remaining EXACT `BHB68xxx` rows.
    //
    // The broad `BHB68xxx -> BM1370` row below is a **prefix catch-all** whose
    // only cited basis is a *preamble* table (`BOSMINER_EEPROM_PARSERS_RE.md`)
    // — and a preamble is a family hint that provably cannot determine an ASIC
    // generation (`0x05 0x11` spans BM1366 AND BM1368). It therefore answered
    // "BM1370" for six SKUs nobody had ever looked at. The ePIC UMC OS v1.22.0
    // jig DB declares all EIGHT `BHB68xxx` roster rows as `asic_id BM1368` /
    // `asic_addr 0x1368` / 108 chips per chain — no `BHB68xxx` board in that
    // roster is BM1370 (the BM1370 boards are the 13 `A3HB*` rows). Four of the
    // six are independently corroborated as 108-chip S21-generation boards by
    // the VNish 1.2.7 model matrix (`BHB68701`/`BHB68703` = Antminer T21,
    // `BHB68707`/`BHB68709` = Antminer S19 XP+).
    //
    // Caveat 3 stands: the ePIC DB is Bitmain-derived but ePIC-TRANSCRIBED and
    // never outranks a DCENT measurement. It is not overruling one here — the
    // value it corrects is a doc inference from a preamble table, not a
    // measurement. Confidence is therefore `medium`, not `high`.
    //
    // These are EXACT keys, never a `BHB687xx` prefix, and they change nothing
    // about admission: `hashboard_eeprom::DEPLOYED_SKU_IDENTITY_POLICY` has no
    // row for any of them, so `observed_protocol_for_deployed_board_name` still
    // refuses all six (pinned by `deployed_bhb68_prefix_never_mints_bm1368`
    // there and by `new_exact_rows_do_not_widen_deployed_admission` here).
    //
    // W8 rank-9 (2026-08-03): the `BHB68xxx -> BM1370` catch-all that used to
    // sit after these rows is REMOVED (see the catalog doc comment above). An
    // unknown `BHB68…` SKU resolves to `None`; only the 8 exact roster rows
    // (BHB68601/68603[-]/68606/68701/68703/68705/68707/68709) answer.
