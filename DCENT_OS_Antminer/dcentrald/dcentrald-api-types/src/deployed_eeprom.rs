//! Deployed Bitmain hashboard-EEPROM decoder — the on-wire format that **real,
//! factory-programmed** boards actually use, distinct from the factory-*jig* block
//! layout in [`crate::zhiju_eeprom`].
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! [`crate::eeprom_record::dispatch`] recognizes the `(0x04,0x11)` and `(0x05,0x11)`
//! preambles but intentionally returns *preamble-only* records. Before this decoder
//! closed the key/framing, the daemon could not identify a real deployed hashboard:
//! the `board_name`/`chip_marking` that discriminate
//! BM1362 vs BM1366 vs BM1398 live **inside the ciphertext**, and
//! [`crate::eeprom_record::scan_known_sku`] can only find a SKU that appears in
//! *plaintext* (which never happens on an encrypted board).
//!
//! This module supplies the missing cipher + framing so the daemon can extract a
//! trustworthy `board_name` and feed it to [`crate::eeprom_record::chip_family_for_sku`].
//!
//! # Provenance (2026-07-24, host-proven)
//!
//! Originally validated byte-exact against **four held real deployed dumps** — the
//! operator's S19j Pro `a lab unit` (BHB42601, header `04 11`, ×2 hashboards) and an S19k
//! Pro (BHB56903, header `05 11`, ×2 hashboards). A 2026-07-26 repo census raised
//! the corpus to **11 distinct real deployed pages** (adding the S21 `BHB68606`
//! dump and `a lab unit` pages recovered from bosminer logs), all of which decode under
//! the same framing. Every held page decodes with **XXTEA key
//! index 1** and the **three-region split** below; the decoded `board_name`,
//! `chip_marking`, and factory V/F reproduce the values read by the shipped
//! `dcent-toolbox` decoder (`projects/dcent-toolbox/.../eeprom_decrypt.py`). The
//! real-dump validation is recorded in
//!  (it is deliberately *not* embedded in
//! this shipped crate, to avoid publishing an operator's hardware serials).
//!
//! ## Corrections this closes (vs the 2026-07-24 census / Wave-A assumptions)
//!
//! * **The deployed key was never unknown.** It is Bitmain jig `key_version = 1`
//!   (`7451ed7c7b5cd872174fe0790a15e4f5`), identical to `skot/amlogic-cb-tools`
//!   `KEY_LARGE[1]` and the shipped toolbox key table. Wave-A's "jig keys don't
//!   decrypt the deployed board" negative was a **region-framing** error (it swept
//!   contiguous single blocks, not the 96-byte region-1 block).
//! * **`0x05` boards use XXTEA, not AES.** Byte 0 is a board-class/version byte;
//!   the algorithm is byte-1's *high* nibble (`0x1` = XXTEA) and the *low* nibble
//!   is the key index. BHB42xxx (`0x04`) and BHB56xxx (`0x05`) share the same key
//!   and framing. The census unlocks "U1 (BHB42 XXTEA key unknown)" and "U2 (BHB56
//!   AES key, DMCA-blocked)" both rested on false premises.
//! * **`chip_marking` is a lot code** (e.g. `L1C021CK11`, `S1GX23CM2E`), NOT an
//!   ASIC-model string. `board_name` (`BHB42601` vs `BHB56903`) is the real
//!   discriminator, exactly as `eeprom_record::BHB_SKU_CATALOG` already encodes.
//!   It does, however, carry ONE reproducible bit of family signal: character 2
//!   of the lot code (region-1 plaintext byte 23). Across all 22 held deployed
//!   pages it is `C` on BM1362 (11), `G` on BM1366 (7), `V` on BM1368 (4), with
//!   no exceptions. That is a **corroborator only** — see
//!   [`DeployedHashboardIdentity::chip_marking_family_letter`] and
//!   `hashboard_eeprom::CHIP_MARKING_FAMILY_LETTERS`. Evidence and the explicit
//!   limits of the rule (no held BM1398/BM1370 page; it does NOT close the
//!   `hashboard_eeprom.rs` BM1362-vs-BM1398 residual): .
//!
//! Cipher/key material is public: `skot/amlogic-cb-tools` (MIT) — the same source
//! the shipped GPL toolbox already ships.
//!
//! # Status & scope
//!
//! **Experimental — decode only.** Pure data: no HAL, no I/O, no write path, and no
//! admission authority. Producing a [`DeployedHashboardIdentity`] does not by itself
//! authorize any hardware mutation; a caller must still pair a decoded identity with
//! the platform's fail-closed admission rules (`hashboard_eeprom::admit_native_experimental`).
