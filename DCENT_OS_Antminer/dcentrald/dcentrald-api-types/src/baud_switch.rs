//!  baud-A — per-chip baud-upgrade plan + triple-write rule (HAL-free).
//!
//! Source RE evidence:
//!
//! (237 lines).
//!
//! All BM13xx / BM14xx chips covered here boot at **115200 8N1** (true rate
//! 115740 bps from `25 MHz / (26+1) / 8`). Most represented SHA-256 families
//! upgrade to a higher operational baud (1.5625 / 3.125 / 6.25 Mbaud). Exact
//! 2017 stock BM1485 is the exception: it remains at nominal 115200. A baud
//! transition, where present,
//! is the single most fragile step in chain init — a single dropped
//! MiscCtrl byte was the root cause of the 75-second zero-nonce stall on
//! S9.
//!
//! This module exposes a HAL-free per-chip plan: which register holds the
//! baud divisor, what value to write, what FPGA divider matches the new
//! baud, the triple-write rule, and the inter-/post-write timing. The
//! BM1362 wire frame is byte-pinned because we have a verified live
//! capture from .139 (2026-04-24).
//!
//! Second witness (provenance hardening, A53 / knowledge-goldmine lane s18):
//! an INDEPENDENT 2023-12-06 Saleae Logic logic-analyzer capture of a live
//! Antminer S19j Pro (BM1362) chain UART decodes the running chain baud as
//! exactly 3,125,000 (3.125 Mbaud) on BOTH chain wires, with the 115200
//! enumeration window confirmed by a paired 420 MHz-vs-545 MHz capture pair
//! (baud is decoupled from PLL freq). That corroborates `target_baud(Bm1362)`
//! from a source entirely separate from the `a lab unit` capture. See
//!
//! (facts S18-F3/F4) and the reusable parser `tools/sal_decode.py`.
//!
//! HAZARD pinned by tests:
//! - `0x40C100B7` is FORBIDDEN for BM1362 — `MISC_CONTROL_INIT | (1 << 16)`
//!   is a no-op because bit 16 is already set; the chain stays at 115200
//!   silently.
//! - Single-write MiscCtrl is BANNED for the admitted upgrade rows. The
//!   exact-stock BM1485 three-write spine uses two distinct values, addressed
//!   writes, and 2/100-ms delays; this generic plan cannot represent it and
//!   remains refused for BM1485.
