//! FPGA bitstream **identity, provenance, and lifecycle contracts** (HAL-free).
//!
//!  / W8, 2026-08-03. Closes the read-only half of `GAP-C2-3` ("no
//! bitstream identity, version, or provenance — anywhere") and pins the
//! `GAP-C2-2` refusal ("the signed-package bitstream slot is validated and then
//! ignored"). Census that produced both gaps:
//! .
//!
//! # Scope, stated up front
//!
//! Everything here is **pure, read-only, and about an artifact at rest**. This
//! module:
//!
//! * parses the ASCII identity header a Xilinx `.bit` file carries, so a
//!   bitstream *file* can name itself (design, part, build date/time);
//! * classifies an artifact that has **no** such header, and reports
//!   [`BitstreamArtifactKind::Unknown`] rather than guessing;
//! * records what DCENT actually holds, per artifact, with measured bytes.
//!
//! It deliberately does **not**:
//!
//! * program, write, install, or stage a bitstream anywhere;
//! * claim to know which bitstream a running unit's PL fabric is configured
//!   with. See [`LOADED_FABRIC_IDENTITY_IS_UNDETERMINED`] — that remains an
//!   open negative, and the honest answer is `UNKNOWN`.
//!
//! # Why "no installer" is a deliberate refusal, not an omission
//!
//! The signed sysupgrade package admits an `fpga_bitstream.bit` payload leaf,
//! validates it (exactly-one/zero bidirectional consistency, manifest hash
//! binding), and then **installs nothing**. That is correct and must stay
//! correct:
//!
//! 1. A package-directed write target is exactly the blast-radius expansion the
//!    campaign's blocked-items section forbids.
//! 2. On a Zynq whose `BOOT.bin` carries the **RSA-verified** fabric stage, a
//!    bitstream write is a **brick vector with no software route back** — the
//!    boot chain is `BootROM -> FSBL(RSA) -> FPGA(RSA) -> U-Boot(RSA) -> ...`.
//!
//! The source contract in this module's test section pins that no-op so it
//! stays deliberate and greppable.
//!
//! # Held artifacts (measured 2026-08-03, desk only, no hardware)
//!
//! See [`HELD_BITSTREAM_ARTIFACTS`]. Only **one** of the four held Zynq
//! artifacts carries a readable identity header.
