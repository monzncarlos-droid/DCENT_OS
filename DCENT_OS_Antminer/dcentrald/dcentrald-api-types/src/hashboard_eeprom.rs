//! Capability-first hashboard-EEPROM identity bridge.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! Two byte-exact Bitmain hashboard-EEPROM decoders now exist —
//! [`crate::zhiju_eeprom`] (BHB42xxx, block `0x42`, preamble byte 0 = `0x04`) and
//! [`crate::bm1366_eeprom`] (BHB56902, block `0x48`, preamble byte 0 = `0x05`) — and the
//! RE proved they share one CRC5, one length-gate discipline, and one identity-field
//! layout. Rather than let every future family copy a third decoder, this module is the
//! single, capability-first entry point: dispatch on the family byte, decode, and — where
//! the evidence is EXACT — produce the independent `observed` [`AsicProtocolIdentity`]
//! that [`dcentrald_common::BoardDesc::admit_asic_protocol`] needs as its second source.
//!
//! # The safety-critical asymmetry (do not weaken)
//!
//! The whole point of the two-source admission is that `observed` identity must be
//! **exact**. That is only true for some families:
//!
//! - **`0x05` (BHB56xxx)** is a UNIQUE family byte. An EEPROM with byte0 `0x05` and a
//!   `BHB56902` serial prefix is an unambiguous BM1366 NoPic board → observed
//!   [`AsicProtocolIdentity::Bm1366`]. This is the exact evidence that lets the native
//!   BM1366 refusal become a gated Experimental path.
//! - **`0x04` (BHB42xxx)** is SHARED between BM1398 (S19 Pro) and BM1362 (S19j Pro). The
//!   zhiju block carries no ASIC-model field, so byte0 `0x04` alone CANNOT disambiguate
//!   them. This resolver therefore returns `observed = None` for the `0x04` family — a
//!   deliberate, load-bearing refusal. Disambiguating BM1398 needs an EXTERNAL source
//!   (Config.ini `board_name`→`asic_type`, or a confirmed `hashboard_sn` prefix), which
//!   is not yet pinned to real board strings. Never map `0x04` to a concrete chip here.
//!
//! # Status
//!
//! Pure, host-testable, no HAL/IO. Produces identity evidence only; it authorizes
//! nothing on its own — a caller still pairs `observed` with the declared BoardDesc via
//! `admit_asic_protocol` and applies the platform's Experimental gates.
