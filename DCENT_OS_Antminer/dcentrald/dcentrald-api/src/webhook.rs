//! Outbound webhook event dispatch — the event-bus → webhook bridge.
//!
//! # Why this module exists (W8 parity gap — Group C)
//!
//! DCENT_OS already has the *plumbing* for webhook notifications:
//!   - `[webhook]` config (`enabled` / `url` / `events`) in `dcentrald::config`,
//!   - REST endpoints (`GET`/`POST /api/config/webhook` + `/test`) in `rest.rs`,
//!   - a `RuntimeWebhookConfig` reloader and an inline POST task in
//!     `dcentrald::daemon`.
//!
//! …but that inline task is fed **only** by the thermal loop's
//! `mpsc::channel::<AlertEvent>`. The wide set of operationally-significant
//! events the W8 comparison flagged — mining start/stop, pool failover,
//! share-accept milestones, OTA — flow through the daemon's *event bus*
//! (the `broadcast::Sender<String>` mining-sync channel that carries
//! `WsMiningSyncMessage`, plus direct daemon call sites) and were never wired
//! to webhook dispatch. BraiinsOS fires webhooks on these; DCENT did not.
//!
//! This module closes that gap *inside `dcentrald-api`* (the webhook owner
//! crate) with three reusable pieces:
//!   1. [`WebhookEvent`] — a typed superset of the events worth notifying on,
//!      whose [`WebhookEvent::event_name`] strings match the canonical
//!      `WEBHOOK_SUPPORTED_EVENTS` filter list in `rest.rs`.
//!   2. [`WebhookDispatcher`] — a fire-and-forget POST engine on its own task:
//!      bounded queue, bounded per-attempt timeout, bounded retry, full
//!      payload redaction. It NEVER blocks or panics a caller (the mining
//!      loop), even if the endpoint is down or slow.
//!   3. [`spawn_mining_sync_bridge`] — the actual event-bus subscriber. It
//!      subscribes to the daemon's mining-sync `broadcast` channel and
//!      translates the relevant events into [`WebhookEvent`]s, enqueueing them
//!      on the dispatcher.
//!
//! # Safety contract (load-bearing)
//!
//! - **Default-OFF.** With no webhook URL configured (`enabled = false` or
//!   empty `url`), [`WebhookDispatcher::dispatch`] drops every event before
//!   any network I/O. No URL ⇒ no dispatch ⇒ byte-identical behaviour. This is
//!   the same gate the inline `daemon.rs` task already enforces.
//! - **Never blocks the caller.** Enqueue is a non-blocking `try_send` on a
//!   bounded channel; if the queue is full the event is dropped with a debug
//!   log, never awaited. All HTTP happens on the dispatcher's own task.
//! - **Bounded everything.** Per-attempt timeout (default 5 s) + a small
//!   bounded retry count (default 2 retries) with a short backoff. A dead or
//!   slow endpoint can never accumulate unbounded outstanding work.
//! - **Redacted payloads.** Every string field that could carry a wallet
//!   address or pool credential is run through
//!   [`dcentrald_common::wallet_mask`] before serialization. Pool URLs are
//!   host-only (no `stratum+tcp://…?password=` query bleed).
//!
//! This module is HAL-free and host-testable. It does not touch hardware,
//! mining state, fans, power, or config files.
