//! BM1387 protocol reference (S9, S17, T9+, S11; 16nm).
//!
//! W11.10 (DCENT_OS Dev Kit Integration, 2026-05-09): codifies the BM1387
//! UART/serial command parameters from the RE2  §8.1
//! (BM1387 Protocol) and `DCENT_OS_HARDWARE_CATALOG.md` §4.1 (chip family
//! catalog) and §7.1 (protocol matrix). This module is **reference-only**.
//! The live BM1387 driver lives at `drivers/bm1387.rs` and the on-fleet
//! am1-s9 sustained-mining path is sustained-validated since 2026-04-19
//!. No live-path code is
//! changed here; we only add a top-level reference catalog the way
//! `bm1362.rs` (orchestration) sits next to `drivers/bm1362.rs` (driver).
//!
//! ## Why a separate module instead of growing `drivers/bm1387.rs`?
//!
//! `drivers/bm1387.rs` is the [`crate::drivers::ChipDriver`] implementation
//! — it owns register layouts, frame builders, MiscCtrl/PLL constants, and
//! per-chain state. The reference module here pins the **parameter
//! envelope** (baud range, work_id width, nonce width, CRC type) so that
//! cross-platform code (autotuner, dashboard, FPGA-side work-id math) can
//! depend on the catalog without pulling the entire driver. That mirrors
//! how `bm1393.rs` codifies the BM1393 catalog ahead of any live driver.
//!
//! ## Catalog source
//!
//! - RE2 §8.1 — BM1387 protocol summary: ~63 ASICs/chain on S9, ~162
//!   ASICs/chain on T9+, daisy-chained through FPGA/Altera C5, 32-bit
//!   header (type, address, length) + payload.
//! - RE2 `DCENT_OS_HARDWARE_CATALOG.md` §4.1 — 16nm, 32 cores, custom
//!   3-wire serial / UART, baud 115200-937500, HW CRC, 8-bit work_id,
//!   32-bit nonce, used in S9, S17, T17, S11.
//! - RE2 `DCENT_OS_HARDWARE_CATALOG.md` §7.1 — protocol matrix:
//!   BM1387 uses the legacy custom-3-wire fixed-128-bit framing with HW
//!   CRC, NOT the BM139x-style register-prefix UART frame. The on-fleet
//!   S9 firmware uses the UART path with FPGA-side framing (see
//!   `drivers/bm1387.rs`). The legacy 3-wire fallback is documented here
//!   for reference only — it appears in early S9 control-board firmware
//!   and in datasheet-level documentation.
//!
//! ## Hard rules (NEVER violate when reading from this catalog)
//!
//! - The **on-fleet am1-s9 BM1387 path is load-bearing and live-validated
//!   since 2026-04-19**. Do NOT change anything in `drivers/bm1387.rs`,
//!   `s9_hybrid_mining.rs`, the PIC heartbeat path, or the MiscCtrl
//!   triple-write path (
//!   ). This module only exposes
//!   constants; it does not provide an alternative driver.
//! - BM1387 CMD IDs are `0x04` (GetAddress) and `0x05` (ChainInactive) —
//!   NOT `0x02`/`0x03` (those are BM1397+).
//!   .
//! - BM1387 SETCONFIG header is `0x58` (broadcast) / `0x48` (single chip),
//!   distinct from BM1397+ `0x51`/`0x41` WRITE_ALL/WRITE_SINGLE.
//! - Open-core requires 114 dummy work items with `gate_block=1` in
//!   MiscCtrl; without it, all 114 SHA-256 cores remain blocked and
//!   produce zero nonces.
//! - 8-bit work_id MUST match the FPGA work_id slot —
//!   . Do not store as `u16`.
