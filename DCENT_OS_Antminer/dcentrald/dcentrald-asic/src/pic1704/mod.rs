//! PIC1704 voltage controller — short-form I2C register protocol.
//!
//! PIC1704 is a third PIC family used by DCENT_OS, distinct from:
//!
//! - `crate::pic` — PIC16F1704 on S9 hash boards (raw `[55 AA cmd ...]`
//!   preamble protocol, two firmware families: stock and BraiinsOS).
//! - `crate::dspic` — dsPIC33EP16GS202 on S17 / S19 / S19j Pro am2 hash
//!   boards (framed `[55 AA LEN CMD ... SUM]` protocol, multiple firmware
//!   revisions: 0x82 / 0x86 / 0x89 / 0x8A / 0xB9 / 0xFE).
//!
//! PIC1704 is the **short-form register-access** family used on:
//! - S19j Pro CV1835 (Sophgo CV1835 SoC, eMMC-rooted variant).
//! - AM335x BB (BeagleBone-class control board, S19j Pro variant).
//! - Amlogic S19j Pro variants.
//!
//! The wire protocol is plain I2C register access: write `[reg_addr,
//! data...]` to write, write `[reg_addr]` then read N bytes to read. No
//! preamble, no length byte, no checksum. Source of truth:
//! `DCENT_OS_DEVELOPMENT_KIT_FROMRE1/SOURCE_HAL/pic1704.{h,c}` from the
//! W2 RE deliverable.
//!
//! # Why this is a separate module
//!
//! Although PIC1704 shares the "voltage controller" role with `pic` and
//! `dspic`, the wire format and parser semantics are different enough
//! that mixing them in one module would obscure the per-family rules.
//! In particular, the 16-zero-byte parser flush mandated by
//!  is a **dsPIC-only** safety
//! rule — see the comment in `protocol.rs` for the full reasoning.
//!
//! # Public API
//!
//! - [`Pic1704State`] / [`classify_version`]: protocol primitives, host-safe.
//! - [`Pic1704Service`]: service-thread-backed runtime controller.
//! - [`service::Pic1704Authorized`] / [`service::platforms`]: sealed-trait
//!   construction whitelist (replaces with real `dcentrald-hal::platform::*`
//!   markers in wave A5).
//!
//! # Safety guarantees
//!
//! - **Sealed-trait construction gate.** `Pic1704Service::new` requires a
//!   marker type that implements [`service::Pic1704Authorized`]. Only
//!   the platforms in [`service::platforms`] satisfy that bound. Out-of-
//!   crate code cannot add new platforms because the trait is sealed.
//! - **No raw I2C.** The service routes all I/O through `I2cServiceHandle`,
//!   honoring the AM2 SINGLE-I2C-OWNER rule (one process owns
//!   `/dev/i2c-N`).
//! - **RESET is research/test-only.** `Pic1704Service::reset` only exists
//!   behind the `recovery-tool` Cargo feature. No shipped package enables
//!   that feature, so neither `dcentrald` nor the diagnostic-only
//!   `pic-recovery` package can link the method. See
//!   .
//! - **Programmer ops are protocol research only.** The bootloader
//!   programmer surface (`pic_seek_1704`, `pic_erase_1704`,
//!   `pic_write_1704`, `pic_start_app_common`) lives in
//!   [`programmer`] and only exists when `recovery-tool` is enabled.
//!   No shipped consumer enables it. The token and bootloader-state checks
//!   preserve research invariants; they are not sufficient deployment
//!   authority. Any future mutating executor requires a separate, typed
//!   controller-recovery authority architecture.
