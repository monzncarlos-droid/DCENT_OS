//! `Pic1704Service` — service-thread-backed PIC1704 controller.
//!
//! Mirrors the shape of `crate::dspic::Pic0x89Service` (S19j Pro am2 dsPIC):
//! a thin struct holding an `I2cServiceHandle`, an address, cached state,
//! and a heartbeat throttle. All I/O is serialized through the process-wide
//! I2C service thread per the AM2 SINGLE-I2C-OWNER architecture rule —
//! callers MUST NOT bypass the service with raw `I2cBus::open(0)`.
//!
//! # Construction is sealed-trait-gated
//!
//! `Pic1704Service::new` requires a `_marker: P` argument where
//! `P: Pic1704Authorized`. The trait is sealed (cannot be implemented
//! outside this crate) and is only implemented for the platform marker
//! types whitelisted in [`platforms`]. This is the platform-isolation
//! guarantee from the W2 RE deliverable spec.
//!
//! The marker types live in this crate (NOT `dcentrald-hal`) because
//! `dcentrald-asic` depends on `dcentrald-hal` — moving the markers to
//! the hal side would form a dep cycle. A5's wave-2A.2 closure pinned
//! this decision; future agents must not "fix" the apparent placeholder
//! TODO by relocating them..
//!
//! # RESET is research/test-only
//!
//! The `reset()` method only exists when the `recovery-tool` Cargo feature
//! is enabled. No shipped package enables that feature, so neither `dcentrald`
//! nor the diagnostic-only `pic-recovery` package can link it. See
//! . A future reset executor requires separate,
//! typed controller-recovery authority; this method's feature gate alone is
//! not sufficient authorization.
