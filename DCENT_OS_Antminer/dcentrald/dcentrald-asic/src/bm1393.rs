//! BM1393 protocol reference (S9k, 7nm).
//!
//! W11.10 (DCENT_OS Dev Kit Integration, 2026-05-09): codifies the BM1393
//! UART command set and core register catalog from the RE2
//!  §8.3 (UART Command Set) and §8.5 (Core
//! Registers). This module is **reference-only** — it is not yet wired to
//! any live driver. The on-fleet S9 path (am1-s9, BM1387) is unaffected.
//!
//! ## Why a separate module instead of growing `drivers/bm139x.rs`?
//!
//! `drivers/bm139x.rs` is the shared command framing helper for the
//! BM1397 / BM1398 / BM1396 / BM1362 / BM1366 / BM1368 line. BM1393 is the
//! 7nm S9k chip, in the same BM139x family but with its own documented
//! 14-opcode catalog and 8-register core map. We pin the catalog here so
//! a future S9k driver implementation can pull from a single source of
//! truth that matches RE2 exactly, instead of re-reading the doc every
//! time.
//!
//! ## Catalog source
//!
//! - RE2 §8.3 — 14 UART opcodes (`SET_BAUD` through `GENERAL_I2C`).
//! - RE2 §8.5 — 8 core registers (`CLOCK_DELAY_CTRL` through
//!   `SWEEP_CLOCK_CTRL`).
//! - RE2 `DCENT_OS_HARDWARE_CATALOG.md` §4.1 — chip family table:
//!   BM1393 = 7nm, UART 937500 baud, CRC8, 8-bit work_id, 32-bit nonce,
//!   used in S9k.
//! - RE2 `DCENT_OS_HARDWARE_CATALOG.md` §7.1 — protocol matrix:
//!   BM1391/3/6/7 share the register-prefix UART frame with CRC8. The
//!   exact CRC8 polynomial for the BM1391/3/6/7 sub-family is **not**
//!   pinned in RE2 R2; only BM1362 and BM1368 are explicitly confirmed
//!   `poly=0x31`. We therefore treat the BM1393 polynomial as `TBD` here
//!   and defer to RE2 R3 to confirm whether BM1393 also uses 0x31 or a
//!   different CRC8 polynomial (e.g. SMBus 0x07).
//!
//! ## Hard rules (NEVER violate when wiring this to a future driver)
//!
//! - `BM1393_WORK_ID_BITS = 8`. The FPGA work_id is also 8 bits — see
//!   . Storing as `u16` and truncating to
//!   `u8` later is the documented bug pattern that loses 89% of nonces.
//! - `BM1393_BAUD_DEFAULT = 937500`. RE2 §8.3 lists `SET_BAUD = 0x06`,
//!   but the operating baud is the BM139x family default 937500. Don't
//!   confuse the *opcode* with the *value*.
//! - `BM1393_NONCE_BITS = 32`. The 64-bit nonces apply to BM1362/1366
//!   (S19j Pro / S19 / S21), NOT BM1393.
//! - The 14 opcodes here are the **command catalog only**. Wire-frame
//!   layout (preamble, length, payload, CRC8) is in
//!   `drivers/bm139x.rs::fifo_*` for BM139x-style chips. BM1393 has not
//!   been live-tested against those helpers.
