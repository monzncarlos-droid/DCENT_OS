//! ASIC chip driver registry and ChipDriver trait.
//!
//! The ChipDriver trait is the central abstraction that makes Universal Hash
//! Board Compatibility possible. Each ASIC chip family implements this trait
//! with its specific initialization sequence, register values, job format,
//! and nonce decoding.
//!
//! The ChipRegistry maps chip IDs to driver instances:
//!   0x1387 -> BM1387 (S9)
//!   0x1397 -> BM1397 (S17/T17)
//!   0x1398 -> BM1398 (S19/S19j)
//!   0x1362 -> BM1362 (S19j Pro)
//!   0x1366 -> BM1366 (S19XP)
//!   0x1368 -> BM1368 (S21)
//!   0x1370 -> BM1370 (S21 Pro)
//!   0x1373 -> BM1373 (S23) [SCAFFOLD — pre-hardware]
//!   0x1485 -> BM1485 (L3 / L3+ / L3++ Scrypt) [SCAFFOLD — refuses to
//!     energize. ⚠ SYNTHETIC key: real BM1485 silicon has no readable
//!     CHIP_ID (`bm1485::CHIP_ID_IS_SILICON_READABLE == false`), so this id
//!     can never arrive from a live enumeration.]
//!   0x1489 -> BM1489 (L7 / L9 Scrypt) [SCAFFOLD — simulator only,
//!     wave-7 W7-F. AML S11board byte-identical with S19j Pro/S21 per
//!      §1.1.]
//!
//! ## `cores_per_chip` vs `nonce_attribution_cores` (W6.8, 2026-05-07)
//!
//! `MinerProfile` carries TWO core-count fields and they are *not*
//! interchangeable:
//!
//! - **`cores_per_chip`** — the driver-facing "engine count". Mirrors what
//!   `ChipDriver::cores_per_chip()` returns. Used by chip-init code that
//!   must address each big SHA-256 engine (e.g. BM1387 open-core dummy
//!   work dispatch).
//! - **`nonce_attribution_cores`** — the count of distinct nonce slots the
//!   FPGA can attribute back to a chip. Used by all hashrate / nonces-per-
//!   second math (`MinerProfile::expected_nps`,
//!   `dcentrald_autotuner::chip_geometry::expected_nps_for_chip`,
//!   chip-health expected-NPS gating, autotuner binary-search nonce
//!   thresholds).
//!
//! For most chip families the two values are identical (BM1387=114,
//! BM1366=894, BM1368=1280). **BM1362 is the exception**:
//! `cores_per_chip = 4` big engines vs a much larger slot count. Mixing
//! the two breaks hashrate prediction by an order of magnitude on BM1362
//! and by 30% on BM1368 (the legacy autotuner constant of 894 was wrong
//! for BM1368).
//!
//! ## SG-1 corrected slot counts (rank 24, 2026-08-02 hardware-enablement queue)
//!
//! Two `nonce_attribution_cores` rows are internally inconsistent with the
//! same profile's own `ghs_per_mhz` (identity: `slots ≈ ghs_per_mhz ×
//! 1000`, see `expected_nps`):
//!
//! - **BM1362**: declared 894, our own `ghs_per_mhz = 0.550` implies ~550.
//!   Corrected value **514** (7.0% from our own implied value, inside the
//!   rank-3 gate's 10% bar; 894 is 38.5% off and over-predicts, so a
//!   healthy chain ratios ~0.615 < `min_hashrate_ratio` 0.70 → permanent
//!   `step_down_freq` throttling of healthy S19j Pro silicon).
//! - **BM1370**: declared 1280 (copied from BM1368, never measured), our
//!   own `ghs_per_mhz = 2.286` implies ~2286. Corrected value **2040**,
//!   independently held in OUR OWN live-mining ESP tree (Bitaxe Gamma
//!   BM1370: `dcentos-esp/dcentaxe/src/{api.rs:992, capabilities.rs:237,
//!   main.rs:853}`). 2040 is 12.06% from the implied 2286 — outside the
//!   10% bar — because 2286 stands on the PLACEHOLDER 525 MHz spec
//!   frequency; the residual is pinned, not hidden, in
//!   `tests/profile_core_ghs_consistency_gate.rs`.
//!
//! The corrected values ship behind the **default-OFF** env flag
//! [`SG1_CORRECTED_NONCE_CORES_ENV`]; with the flag unset, every declared
//! field and every prediction is byte-identical to the pre-rank-24 tree.
//! Prediction paths consume [`MinerProfile::nonce_attribution_cores_effective`]
//! (or `expected_nps`, which routes through it); the raw field remains the
//! declared legacy default and is what the rank-3 consistency gate pins.
//!
//! Single source of truth: `dcentrald-autotuner` consumes
//! `MinerProfile::nonce_attribution_cores_effective` directly. Per-chip
//! core constants in `dcentrald-autotuner::chip_geometry` were deleted in
//! W6.8 and the offline CI gate `chip_geometry_drift_check` rejects their
//! reintroduction.
