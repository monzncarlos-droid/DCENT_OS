//! LuxOS-shape thermal supervisor (RE-005 closure, Wave E 2026-05-19).
//!
//! Six-layer thermal supervision FSM layered ON TOP of the existing
//! `crate::controller::ThermalController` PID loop. Per the RE team handoff at
//!
//! §RE-005, the supervisor consumes per-tick sensor readings (board PCB
//! temps, chip die temps, fan tachs, optional hydro inlet/outlet) and emits
//! action *requests* to the controller without replacing it (autotuner stays
//! master per the plan).
//!
//! # Source of truth
//!
//! Clean-room implementation from the RE-005 handoff. No proprietary code
//! copied. Thresholds (target 55 C / hot 65 C / panic 70 C / chip_hot 93 C /
//! chip_panic 100 C) and ATM windows (5 C / 8 C / 15 min startup / 15 min
//! post-ramp) come from the documented LuxOS config surface, not from binary
//! reverse-engineering. Confidence per RE-005: MEDIUM for behavior;
//! MEDIUM-LOW for exact tick cadence + exact fan curve formula because the
//! live `a lab unit` capture did not cross hot/panic thresholds. Wave E parameterizes
//! the unknowns as TOML knobs rather than hardcoding them.
//!
//! # Opt-in safety
//!
//! This module is COMPILED but NOT INSTANTIATED into the running daemon by
//! default. The integration site in the controller will be gated on
//! `[thermal.supervisor].enabled = true` in `dcentrald.toml`; with that flag
//! false (default), the existing controller stays master and supervisor
//! actions are not emitted. Wave G/H is the integration wave; this wave
//! ships defensive code that's safety-reviewable in isolation.
//!
//! # Load-bearing rules
//!
//! - **Quiet-home `fan_max_pwm` cap MUST NOT be exceeded.** `RequestFansMax`
//!   means "request fans up to `fan_max_pwm`", NOT 100% PWM. Raising the cap
//!   above the per-platform home-unit floor requires explicit operator config
//!   edit. Cut-hash-before-noise stays the default escalation order. Enforced
//!   by `tests::request_fans_max_respects_quiet_home_cap`.
//! - **Supervisor is a REQUESTOR.** The autotuner stays master for any
//!   profile step decisions; `RequestProfileStepUp/Down` are advisories the
//!   autotuner can decline if it has stronger signals. Enforced by
//!   `tests::atm_step_request_does_not_force_autotuner`.
//! - **Emergency-shutdown beats DPS.** When `RequestEmergencyShutdown` is
//!   emitted, the caller's existing `DangerousShutdown` / power-cut path
//!   takes precedence over any DPS governor action. The supervisor does NOT
//!   call into hardware directly.
//!
//! # State machine
//!
//! ```text
//!   per tick:
//!     1. reliability_filter(board_sensors) -> valid_board
//!     2. reliability_filter(chip_sensors)  -> valid_chip
//!     3. classify each board:
//!          board_max >= board_panic -> RequestBoardPowerOff
//!          chip_max  >= chip_panic  -> RequestBoardPowerOff
//!          board_max >= hot        -> RequestFansMax + RequestProfileStepDown
//!          board_max >= target     -> RequestFansCurve + ATM hold
//!          else (cool, post-grace) -> RequestFansMin + maybe RequestProfileStepUp
//!     4. fan health:
//!          working_fan_count < min_fans -> RequestEmergencyShutdown (FanPanic)
//!          single fan tach 0           -> emit FanFailure (continue mining
//!                                          unless thresholds escalate)
//!     5. recovery:
//!          if board off + cool band + reboot budget remains -> attempt
//!          recovery; else leave off + emit BudgetExhausted
//! ```

/// falls below `min_per_board` → `RequestBoardPowerOff{SensorFailure}` even
/// though two sensors plainly agree. That is the "one bad sensor poisons the
/// whole board" defect this finding targets.
///
/// The median has a 50 % breakdown point: as long as the majority of sensors
/// agree, the reference tracks the agreeing cluster and only the genuine
/// outlier is flagged. For `[55, 55, 90]` the median is 55, so only the 90
/// deviates — exactly one sensor is dropped, the two good sensors survive, and

/// Fail-closed is preserved by construction: this filter only *drops* sensors,
/// it never resurrects one or weakens a threshold. When agreement genuinely
/// collapses (e.g. a 2-vs-2 split, or every sensor truly diverging) enough

/// (all sensors reading high but *together*) produces a tight cluster, a high
/// median, and zero spurious drops, so the genuine `board_hot` / `board_panic`
