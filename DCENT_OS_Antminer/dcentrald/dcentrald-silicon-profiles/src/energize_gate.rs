//!  B2 (2026-05-22): runtime hashboard-SKU energize-refusal gate.
//!
//! **Drive-half** of matrix §7 #15. The observe-half (Wave K) shipped
//! per-chain EEPROM-preamble telemetry/classification in `daemon.rs`. This
//! module is the load-bearing fail-closed gate the **mining paths** call
//! BEFORE any `set_voltage` / `enable_voltage` / `cold_boot_init` on a
//! chain.
//!
//! ## What this gate refuses
//!
//! §7 #15 (drive-half):
//!
//! 1. **Malformed EEPROM preamble** — the first 2 bytes are not one of
//!    the canonical hashboard-family markers (`0x04 0x11` BHB42xxx;
//!    `0x05 0x11` BHB56902 NoPic), AND not all-`0xFF` or all-`0x00`
//!    (the unpopulated / empty case, which is treated as "no board" and
//!    silently skipped — not a refusal).
//! 2. **AM2 EEPROM readiness timeout** — the per-chain EEPROM read
//!    didn't complete within the operator-supplied deadline. Fail
//!    closed: a dsPIC that doesn't surface its EEPROM in time is in an
//!    unknown state.
//! 3. **Mixed-SKU chains** — chain N reports BHB42xxx while chain M
//!    reports BHB56902 (or any other cross-family pairing). A mixed
//!    fleet's PVT envelopes don't align, so we refuse the whole
//!    platform rather than driving any chain at a wrong setpoint.
//! 4. **Per-chain profile-binding failure** — the readable preamble
//!    doesn't classify to ANY known SKU (`classify_by_eeprom_preamble`
//!    returns `None`). Treated identically to (1).
//!
//! ## What this gate does NOT do
//!
//! - **`(freq, voltage)` PVT-envelope validation** lives in
//!   [`crate::pvt_envelope::validate_freq_volt`] (W13.C3). This gate
//!   only resolves the SKU binding. Mining paths that already drove
//!   chains MUST plug the resolved [`SkuBinding`] back into
//!   `validate_freq_volt` before each setpoint write.
//! - **Live S9 / am1-s9 routing** — BHB-S9 / BHB-S11 / BHB-S17
//!   hashboards have no pinned preamble in [`crate::hashboards`]; this
//!   gate treats them as a known "non-AT24-EEPROM platform" and never
//!   blocks am1-s9. Only PicType::NoPic and PicType::DsPic33Ep paths
//!   (am2 / am3 BB / am3-aml) ever call this gate.
//!
//! ## Env gating (rollout pattern, /22 style)
//!
//! `DCENT_AM2_STRICT_SKU_REFUSE=1` flips the gate from
//! **telemetry-only** (log + record a refusal reason but proceed) to
//! **strict-refuse** (return `Err(EnergizeRefusal)` — the caller is
//! expected to tear down without energizing).
//!
//! For the **first deploy** we ship default-OFF: the gate logs every
//! refusal decision so the operator can confirm `a lab unit`'s BHB42601
//! chains classify cleanly and no false-positive refusal is recorded;
//! only AFTER that confirmation do we promote the env-default to ON in
//! a follow-up  commit.
//!
//! Lab override: `DCENT_AM2_ACCEPT_DEGRADED_HARDWARE=1` mirrors the
//! existing toolbox `--accept-degraded-hardware` pattern and lets the
//! strict-refuse branch proceed anyway (still logs LOUDLY). Use only
//! when bringing up a known-good unit with a flaky EEPROM bus.
//!
//! ## Cross-references
//!
//! -  — 0x50-0x57 are READ-OK,
//!   write-denied.
//! -  — fw=0x86 refusal at the dsPIC
//!   layer. This gate is the layer ABOVE that: refuses on EEPROM-side
//!   evidence even before any dsPIC commands fly.
//! -  — XIL `a lab unit`
//!   classifies as BHB42601 (`a lab unit`'s class). Whatever this gate
//!   accepts for `a lab unit` MUST also accept `a lab unit`.

    // parallel runner, without changing a single assertion.
