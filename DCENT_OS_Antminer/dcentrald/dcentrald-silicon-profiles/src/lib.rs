//! Canonical silicon characterization tables for the ASIC families
//! DCENT_OS supports.
//!
//! Each table is a discrete, integer-step `Profile` index pairing target
//! frequency (MHz), chain voltage (V), expected wall power (W, all boards),
//! and expected nameplate hashrate (TH/s, all boards). The tables are derived
//! from live `cgminer-API profiles` output captures of competitor firmware
//! (LuxOS, BraiinsOS+) and reverse-engineering notes in
//!  and .
//!
//! Every row is labeled `live-confirmed` (lifted verbatim from a live capture)
//! or `reconstructed` (linear-extrapolated from the cadence proven by
//! confirmed rows). Reconstructed rows must be re-verified the next time a
//! session has live API access — see the source RE document for the
//! re-verification checklist.
//!
//! This crate is pure data + light helpers. It has zero HAL dependency so
//! the autotuner, dashboard, and toolbox can all consume the same canonical
//! profile tables.
//!
//! Provenance / source documents:
//! - BM1362:
//!   (LUXminer 2026.4.3.192353 on Antminer S19j Pro at 203.0.113.79).
//!
//! Other ASIC families (BM1366/BM1368/BM1387/BM1398) are stubs in this
//! version pending live capture from a target on each silicon.
