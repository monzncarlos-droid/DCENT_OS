//! Per-model power / efficiency operating-point catalog (S9 → S21).
//!
//! ## Why this module exists (and is additive, never a regression)
//!
//! The existing [`crate::Profile`] / [`crate::SiliconTable`] catalog is a
//! discrete *integer-step* curve per **chip family** (BM1387, BM1398, …).
//! It is the canonical autotuner step ladder and stays the source of truth
//! for the freq/voltage/step machinery. But it has two structural limits a
//! per-MODEL power harvest needs to overcome:
//!
//!   1. One chip family maps to many MODELS with different geometry and
//!      different watt curves (e.g. BM1397 → S17 Pro / S17+ / T17 / T17+;
//!      BM1398 → S19 / S19 Pro / S19a Pro / S19 Pro Hydro / T19). A single
//!      `SiliconTable` cannot hold all of those curves.
//!   2. `Profile` has no per-board split, no MEASURED-vs-INFERRED-vs-GAP
//!      confidence field, and no per-datum source string. A wrong watt feeds
//!      a wrong autotuner power estimate → thermal / breaker safety risk, so
//!      provenance must be carried *in the data*, never inferred at the call
//!      site.
//!
//! This module is the **harvested, cited, per-model** companion catalog. It
//! does NOT touch `Profile`/`SiliconTable` or the autotuner `c_eff`
//! load-bearing path — it is a new read-only data surface the autotuner and
//! power-target code MAY consult for measured/vendor-extracted watt curves
//! when they exist.
//!
//! ## Provenance discipline (HARVEST + cite, never fabricate)
//!
//! Every [`OperatingPoint`] carries:
//!   - per-board AND per-unit watts + hashrate + J/TH
//!   - a [`PointConfidence`] of `Measured` / `Inferred` / `Gap`
//!   - a `&'static str` `source` citing the exact RE doc / jig Config.ini /
//!     crate row / live capture the number came from
//!
//! A `Gap` point carries `None` for the unknown columns — it is a documented
//! hole, never a guessed number. Consumers MUST treat `Gap` and any `None`
//! column as "unknown", never as fact.
//!
//! ## Sources (cited per row in the data below)
//!
//!
//!   (operator VNish RE — 820 watt~hashrate profiles, J/TH computed).
//!   §3.1-3.4 = LEGACY S17/S17+/T17/T17+ (explicit freq+watt+hashrate);
//!   §2.x / §2.17-2.22 = modern watt~hashrate-only profiles.
//!
//!   (Bitmain stock `levels.json` freq+voltage per hashboard SKU).
//!
//!   K-autotuner-profiles.md` (GOLD live LuxOS BM1362 S19j Pro capture).
//! -  +
//!   *-jig/Config.ini` (factory-test geometry).
//! - The in-crate `bm13xx.rs` `SiliconTable` rows (cross-referenced).
//! - `dcentrald-asic/src/drivers/mod.rs` MINER_PROFILES (the c_eff /
//!   nominal-point power-model table).
//!
//! Voltage convention notes baked into each model:
//!   - `voltage_mv` is the CHAIN-RAIL voltage (~8-15 V) UNLESS the row's
//!     source string says "chip-core" (downstream of the DC-DC, ~1.2-1.6 V).
//!     The two MUST NOT be conflated (a recurring harvest hazard).
//!   - VNish modern profiles carry NO freq/voltage (runtime-derived by the
//!     autotuner from a watt target) → those columns are `None` on those
//!     rows, by design, NOT a data loss.
