//! BM1396 data-only silicon profile.
//!
//! 2026-08-03 mapping correction (W8-G): BM1396 hosts **S17e / T17e**, not
//! S17+ / T17+ (those carry BM1397, `0x1397`). PR-056's reversed attribution
//! is retracted — see the correction banner in
//! .
//!
//! CARRY-FORWARD DEFECT: the five `BM1396_PROFILES` rows and the two
//! `BM1396_CHIPS_PER_CHAIN_*` constants below were harvested as *plus-family*
//! (S17+/T17+) vendor data under the old attribution, so they are filed under
//! the wrong chip. Their VALUES are untouched (chip counts are a separate fact
//! and must not change). Re-homing that vendor curve to `bm1397.rs` /
//! `operating_points::{S17_PLUS,T17_PLUS}` and sourcing real S17e/T17e anchors
//! is follow-up work; nothing outside `platform::sim` consumes them today.
//!
//! BM1396 is intentionally not registered as a runtime chip driver. The rows
//! below are vendor-extracted operating-point anchors for UI/autotuner catalog
//! display and host-side planning only. A live `0x1396` chip enumeration must
//! still fail closed in `dcentrald-asic` until BP-ZYNQ-NAND-BRINGUP captures
//! the chip ID and validates dispatch on owned bench hardware.
