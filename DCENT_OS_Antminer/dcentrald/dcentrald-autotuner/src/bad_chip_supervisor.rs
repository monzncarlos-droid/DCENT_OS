//! Cross-firmware bad-chip / degraded-chip supervisor (RE-004 closure, Wave E
//! 2026-05-19).
//!
//! 4-state per-chip FSM (`Healthy / Degraded / Bad / Missing`) with a two-
//! threshold confidence gate, layered ON TOP of the existing per-window
//! `ChipStatsSnapshot` stream from `crate::chip_stats::ChipStatsSnapshot`. Per
//! the RE team handoff at
//!
//! §"Best-of-Breed Behavior Spec for DCENT_OS", the runtime FSM consumes per-
//! chip nonce + error counts each window, classifies each chip with
//! statistical confidence, and emits action requests (per-chip downclock,
//! per-chip blacklist, board-profile step-down, bounded board reset, halt-
//! mining when too few healthy chips remain).
//!
//! # Source of truth
//!
//! Clean-room implementation from the RE-004 handoff (LuxOS-primary action
//! ladder, VNish policy knobs, BraiinsOS telemetry richness). No proprietary
//! code copied; thresholds and confidence gate are documented behavior, not
//! lifted constants. Confidence per RE-004:
//! - LuxOS lane: HIGH for behavior, MEDIUM for persistence path.
//! - VNish lane: MEDIUM-HIGH for surface, MEDIUM for runtime control-flow.
//! - BraiinsOS lane: MEDIUM for telemetry, LOW-MEDIUM for exact thresholds.
//! - Stock Bitmain: MEDIUM-LOW; per-chip isolation not evidenced.
//!
//! # Opt-in safety
//!
//! This module is COMPILED but NOT INSTANTIATED into the running daemon by
//! default. The integration site is gated on `[autotune.bad_chip].enabled =
//! true` in `dcentrald.toml`; with that flag false (default), the existing
//! autotuner stays master and no per-chip blacklisting happens. Live HW
//! validation (Wave H, with operator per-action authorization) is the gate to
//! enabling it in production.
//!
//! # Load-bearing rules
//!
//! - **Blacklisted chip nonces MUST still submit.** The supervisor only
//!   emits intent (a `BlacklistChip` action); the share-submit path stays
//!   intact and honors any nonce that arrives. Mirror of the Wave-D BIP320
//!   lesson — the supervisor reclassifies *expected* nonce accounting only,
//!   never discards a real valid hash. Enforced by
//!   `tests::blacklisted_chip_nonce_still_submits`.
//! - **Quiet-home fan cap MUST NOT be raised** by any action this supervisor
//!   emits. The supervisor never emits fan-control actions; thermal/fan stays
//!   the thermal supervisor's domain (RE-005).
//! - **HaltMining preserves the cut-hash-before-noise rule.** When emitted,
//!   the caller cuts power but does NOT raise fan PWM.
//!
//! # State machine
//!
//! ```text
//!   Healthy ──(actual < ~85% expected AND z < -2σ AND n >= min_samples)──> Degraded
//!   Degraded ──(actual < ~20% expected AND z < -4σ AND repeated_bad_windows >= 2)──> Bad
//!   Degraded ──(8 consecutive good windows)──> Healthy
//!   Bad ──(24 consecutive good windows)──> Degraded
//!   Bad ──(fingerprint mismatch on reboot)──> Healthy (force retune)
//!   Any ──(missing in chain enumeration)──> Missing
//!   Missing ──(re-enumerated next window)──> Healthy (force retune)
//! ```
//!
//! All actual/expected/z statistics are computed over a TRUE bounded rolling
//! window of the most-recent `ROLLING_WINDOW_CAP` `observe()` calls (W24-BC-2),
//! never lifetime accumulators — so a chip running at a stable sub-100% ratio
//! holds a stable bounded z-score and is never blacklisted by drift, and a
//! recovered chip climbs back out within roughly one window-length.
