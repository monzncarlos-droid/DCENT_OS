//! AT-1: measured chip-rail voltage input for the autotuner.
//!
//! This is the **foundational read-back accessor** that the AT-3..13 DVFS
//! efficiency build sits on top of. It does NOT close any loop and never
//! *adjusts* voltage — it only turns a decoded dsPIC reading into a single,
//! provenance-tagged per-chain rail voltage that the autotuner and the
//! telemetry surfaces can consume. Today every voltage the autotuner sees is
//! the *commanded* (open-loop) DAC setpoint; AT-1 lets a *measured* value take
//! priority where one is available, while falling back — cleanly and tagged —
//! to commanded when it is not.
//!
//! Why it lives here (pure, no-HAL, host-testable):
//!   - The 0x3A `MEASURE_VOLTAGE` decode + plausibility guard already live in
//!     [`crate::dspic_decode`]. This module reuses that decoder verbatim, so the
//!     measured value AT-1 publishes is exactly what `DspicService::measure_voltage`
//!     produces on the live unit — same scale, same misframe rejection.
//!   - `dcentrald-autotuner` and `dcentrald-api` (the telemetry projection) both
//!     consume this. Putting it in the no-HAL leaf crate keeps a single source of
//!     truth reachable from both without dragging in a hardware dependency, and
//!     lets the AT-1 logic be unit-tested on the Windows host (the autotuner /
//!     api crates are HAL-blocked there).
//!
//! Firmware-scale note (RE-ASK-DSPIC-3A-FW8A-SCALE): the 0x3A ADC decode uses
//! the Ghidra-proven fw=0x89 affine fit `volts = raw * 0.02448 - 0.35`. fw=0x8A
//! is currently assumed to share that scale (no independent 0x8A selector path
//! was found in the local `bosminer.bin` RE, and the local trace reported fw=0x89
//! for both `a lab unit` slaves). AT-1 is therefore firmware-agnostic on decode: it
//! consumes whatever [`crate::dspic_decode`] returns and does NOT apply a second,
//! guessed 0x8A scale. If a live `a lab unit` 0x3A capture later proves a distinct 0x8A
//! scale, the fix belongs in `dspic_decode`, not here.
//!
//! Safety scope: AT-1 is READ-BACK only. It performs no I/O itself — the caller
//! supplies either a pre-decoded `Option<u16>` or the raw post-envelope ADC reply
//! bytes. It must never be wired into a hot-path periodic dsPIC read (the 0x3A
//! `I2C_RDWR` read phase can corrupt the dsPIC parser — see
//! `DspicService::measure_voltage`); a safe quiet-window read cadence is AT-3..13
//! work, out of scope here.
//!
//! No serde here on purpose: `dcentrald-common` is intentionally dependency-free
//! (see its `Cargo.toml`). The API surface serializes the `&'static str` tag from
//! [`RailVoltageSource::as_str`], not these types directly, so no derive is needed.
