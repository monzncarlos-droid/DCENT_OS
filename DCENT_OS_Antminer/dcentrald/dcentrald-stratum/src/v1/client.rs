//! Stratum V1 client: async Tokio task managing pool connection lifecycle.
//!
//! The client runs as a long-lived async task. It:
//! 1. Connects to the primary pool (with failover)
//! 2. Performs the handshake (configure, subscribe, authorize)
//! 3. Receives jobs via mining.notify and sends them to the job dispatcher
//! 4. Receives shares from the share validator and submits them to the pool
//! 5. Handles donation time-switching (transparent, voluntary 2% default)
//! 6. Reconnects with exponential backoff on disconnect
//!
//! Communication with the rest of dcentrald is via typed mpsc channels.
