//!  HIGH-8 (2026-05-24) — recipe-broken runtime guard.
//!
//! Fail-closed startup gate that refuses to launch `dcentrald` on
//! `a lab unit`-class AM2-XIL-Loki hardware when any forbidden
//! "must-not-set" `DCENT_AM2_*` env vars from the  PROVEN MINING
//! RECIPE are present in the environment.
//!
//! ## Context
//!
//! First DCENT_OS mining on `a lab unit` was achieved 2026-05-24 ():
//! 12 shares accepted by public-pool.io in 165 s via bosminer-handoff.
//! The proven path requires EXACTLY 13 specific env vars set (see
//! `tests/wave54_proven_mining_recipe.rs`). Four forbidden gates were
//! independently falsified on the live `a lab unit` unit. A fifth was later
//! forbidden after fw71 firmware disassembly proved its purported
//! calibration read was a voltage mutation:
//!
//! | Env var                                    | Why forbidden            |
//! |--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
//! | `DCENT_AM2_PIC_RESET_AND_START_APP`        | BARE warmup transitions chip from fw=0x89 → fw=0x82 |
//! | `DCENT_AM2_PIC_RESET_STRACE_DERIVED`       | FRAMED warmup, same fw transition problem |
//! | `DCENT_AM2_PSU_LOKI_REGISTER_POINTER`      | Loki Enable bytes corrupt spoof state for next bosminer |
//! | `DCENT_AM2_PSU_CALIBRATION_PROBE_WAKE`     | Calibration probe corrupts Loki spoof state |
//! | `DCENT_AM2_APW12_STANDARD_COLD_ENGAGE`      | Retired path included a mislabeled fw71 voltage mutation |
//!
//! ## Decision contract
//!
//! - Fingerprint MUST match on ALL of: `platform == "zynq-bm3-am2"`,
//!   `board_target` ends with `xil` (suffix match), and (if present)
//!   `psu_hardware_variant == "loki"`. If `psu_hardware_variant` is
//!   absent the guard still fires on platform+board_target alone (the
//!   2 forbidden PIC vars affect dsPIC state regardless of PSU, and
//!   `a lab unit` is the only documented XIL-25 unit). The lab-only
//!   `DCENT_AM2_XIL25_FINGERPRINT_OVERRIDE=1` may bridge the deliberate
//!   `am2-s19j` sysupgrade package identity into `a lab unit` diagnostics, but
//!   it still requires the same AM2/Loki-compatible platform fingerprint.
//! - If fingerprint does NOT match (S9, `a lab unit`, `a lab unit`, `a lab unit`, `a lab unit`,
//!   any non-`a lab unit`-class), the guard is a no-op pass.
//! - If fingerprint matches AND any forbidden gate is set
//!   (via the canonical env-helper convention — `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on`
//!   case-insensitive), the guard REFUSES to start (returns
//!   `GuardDecision::Refuse` with the offending names).
//! - Operator override: `DCENT_BYPASS_WAVE54_GUARD=1` flips a
//!   forced refuse → a `Bypass` decision so the caller logs a loud
//!   warning and continues. Lab-only / recovery escape hatch.
//!
//! ## Wiring
//!
//! Called from `main.rs::run_main` AFTER config load + logging init +
//! platform-stamp read, BEFORE any I²C/UIO/PSU/PIC/chain hardware
//! touch. See the call site in `run_main()` just after the
//! `auto-enabled s19j-hybrid` info log, before the silicon-profile
//! registry load.
//!
//! ## Test guarantees
//!
//! See `tests/wave55a_recipe_broken_guard_refuses_forbidden_env_on_xil_25.rs`
//! for the host-runnable regression pins. The pure decision function
//! `evaluate_guard()` is the unit under test (no HAL deps; takes string
//! slices + an env list; returns a pure enum).
//!
//! ## Operator override hint
//!
//! Refusal error message must include both the runbook
//!  and the
//! load-bearing memory rule
//!  so a future
//! agent / operator can find the canonical recipe.
//!
//! ## Exit code
//!
//! On refusal the daemon exits with `EX_CONFIG = 78` (BSD sysexits
//! convention — "configuration error"), distinct from the strict-reject
//! unknown-flag exit code (2) and from generic runtime failures (1).
