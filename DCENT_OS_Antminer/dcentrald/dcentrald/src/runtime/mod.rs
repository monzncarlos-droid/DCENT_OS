//! Runtime subsystems shared by every mining mode.
//!
//! W2.1 + W2.2 (Production Build Plan, 2026-05-07): the `Daemon` god-class in
//! `daemon.rs` was historically the only entry point that wired up the API
//! servers (`:8080` REST + `:4028` CGMiner), MQTT/webhook notifications,
//! share-efficiency telemetry, and hardware-info collection. Other mining
//! modes (`--s19j-hybrid`, `--tap-mode`, `--serial-mining`, `--stock-fpga`,
//! `--stratum-proxy`) bypassed `Daemon::run()` entirely and therefore never
//! brought up the dashboard —.
//!
//! This module hosts the post-W2.1 split:
//!
//! - [`api`] — `spawn_proxy_mode_api` and the minimal `AppState` builder used
//!   by every non-`Daemon` mode. Default trait implementation calls into
//!   here so the dashboard binds on every mode.
//! - [`notifications`] — MQTT + webhook + alert plumbing
//!   (`MqttPublisherTask`, `AlertEvent`, `spawn_mqtt_publisher`,
//!   `RuntimeNotificationConfig`).
//! - [`efficiency`] — `ShareEfficiencyTracker`, PSU efficiency tables,
//!   `now_unix_ms`.
//! - [`hardware_info`] — `collect_hardware_info`, `detect_control_board`,
//!   `read_miner_serial`, `read_hb_type`, `probe_psu_info`,
//!   `read_hashboard_eeprom_fingerprints`, EEPROM fingerprint helpers.
//!
//! ## `MiningRuntime` trait
//!
//! Every mining mode (`Daemon`, `S19jHybridMiner`, `S19jTapMiner`,
//! `SerialMiner`, `StockMiner`, and the `stratum_proxy` wrapper) implements
//! [`MiningRuntime`]. The trait provides default implementations for
//! API-server bring-up so a future mining mode can't accidentally
//! re-introduce the hybrid-mode-no-api regression.
//!
//! Direct hardware orchestration (PIC heartbeat, FPGA UIO open, voltage
//! ramp, single-I2C-owner service spawn) is **not** part of the trait —
//! that lives in mode-specific implementations under `bringup/`. The
//! trait is intentionally small: it is the operator-facing contract
//! ("this thing runs, binds an API, can be cancelled") and nothing more.

/// telemetry channels and calls `dcentrald_api::start_api_servers` directly).
