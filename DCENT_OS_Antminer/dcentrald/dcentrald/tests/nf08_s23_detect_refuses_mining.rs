//! NF-08: the daemon refuses to mine on an Antminer S23 (BM1373).
//!
//! Real S23 silicon self-reports chip-id **0x1372** on enumeration
//! (NerdQAxePlus `chip_id[6]`), while DCENT keys the pre-hardware scaffold on
//! its canonical **0x1373** and dual-keys BOTH ids to the same fail-closed
//! BM1373 scaffold (operator decision 2026-07-08). This test lives in the
//! DAEMON crate (not the ASIC crate) to prove that the *daemon's* and
//! *work-dispatcher's* ASIC-dispatch routes both go through the same
//! env-gated `ChipRegistry`, so an S23 that is absent from `production()`
//! gets NO driver -> NO work -> refusal to mine.
//!
//! It follows the source-pin idiom of `tests/mixed_chip_divergence.rs`
//! (include_str! + `.contains(...)`) for the parts that cannot be exercised
//! host-side (the fail-closed `init_chain`/`send_work` bodies need a live
//! `FpgaChain::open` UIO device; the daemon/dispatcher routing lives in
//! HAL-heavy code paths). Additive + fail-closed: it asserts existing
//! behavior, changes no production source.
