//! Generic **read-only** PMBus telemetry for the PMBus-class Bitmain PSU
//! families (APW3++ / APW7 / APW9 / APW10 / APW11 at I²C `0x58`).
//!
//! # Status: EXPERIMENTAL — DESK-EVIDENCE ONLY
//!
//! Nothing in this module has been verified against a live PSU. It is
//! implemented from the public PMBus 1.3 Part II command set (command codes
//! and the SLINEAR11 / ULINEAR16 numeric formats are specification facts).
//! The Mujina reference miner ships an equivalent generic layer at
//!
//! (+ `pmbus/pmbus_types.rs`, GPL-3.0); it was located and used only as a
//! cross-check that our command codes and 5-bit exponent sign-extension agree
//! with an independent implementation. No Mujina code is copied here, and the
//! decode semantics below are deliberately *not* identical to theirs (see the
//! signed-mantissa note in [`slinear11`]).
//!
//! # Hard invariants (do not weaken)
//!
//! 1. **This layer is read-only.** No output-setting, on/off, fault-clearing,
//!    margin, store/restore, or page-latching command is defined anywhere in
//!    this file. [`PmbusReadCommand`] is the complete command surface and
//!    every variant is a telemetry/status/identity read. There is no encoder,
//!    no `to_*` numeric encoder, and no command-emitting API at all.
//! 2. **Every transaction goes through the existing `I2cServiceHandle`.** The
//!    `0x50..=0x57` EEPROM write denylist and the single-owner I²C service
//!    stay in force; this module never opens a bus, never maps raw physical
//!    memory, and never bypasses the service.
//! 3. **A failed read is never a number.** Every field is a
//!    [`Measured<T>`], whose absent variant carries a typed
//!    [`TelemetryUnknown`] reason. There is deliberately no zero-substituting
//!    accessor and no numeric `Default`: a bus error cannot reach a safety
//!    check or the dashboard disguised as `0 V` or `0 A`.
//! 4. **Nothing auto-enables.** [`PmbusTelemetryGate::from_env`] is
//!    default-OFF; a caller must opt in explicitly. Probing is otherwise
//!    passive (reads only).
//! 5. **No fabricated electrical values.** This module contains no PSU wattage,
//!    efficiency, or calibration constants at all.
//!
//! # SMBus read shape and its honest classification
//!
//! A PMBus read is an SMBus Read Byte/Word/Block: the host writes the command
//! code (a register pointer), then issues a repeated START and reads. The
//! command-code phase puts bytes on the wire, so the HAL classifies it as
//! [`I2cMutationLabel::QueryPrelude`] — "a write-bearing query is a controller
//! mutation even when its protocol-level purpose is observation". That is the
//! correct existing label; this module does not invent a privileged read
//! intent to route around it. No PAGE select is ever issued, so only the
//! device's currently selected page is observable.
