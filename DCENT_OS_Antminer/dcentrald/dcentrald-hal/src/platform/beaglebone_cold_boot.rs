//! AM335x BeagleBone-class byte-exact t=7.8 s → t=9.5 s cold-boot
//! orchestration (R4 W13.B6, W14.A audit-correction).
//!
//! W14.A1 (R4-CONFIRMED): AM335x BB has its own 6-phase trace (phases
//! 1-6) with **phase 5 (MiscCtrl triple-write) opt-in per W4 RE
//! evidence**. The W4 RE binary scan of stock BB bmminer found NO
//! `0x00C100B0` register address and NO `miscctrl` symbol — the previous
//! W13 wording that this module "shares the CV1835 6-substate trace
//! shape" was misleading. The BB trace is structurally similar but
//! phase 5 is materially different: stock BB does NOT emit MiscCtrl.
//! This module preserves the wire frame for forward compat (some future
//! lab board may need the write) but defaults `opts.run_miscctrl_triple_write
//! = false` so no bytes leave the host on the default path.
//!
//! Source of truth: `RE_DELIVERABLES/RE_DELIVERABLES/
//! bmminer_init_trace_am335x.md` (Round-4 RE deliverable) + W4 handoff
//! Critical Action #1 (`am335x_*.{c,h,md}`). This module ports the
//! trace's six observable phases into a single Rust entry point so a
//! future bench operator on the legacy BBCtrl/S70-class carrier can reproduce the sequence under
//! DCENT_OS without touching `bmminer`.
//!
//! ## Hardware-acquisition note
//!
//! **Bench validation of that legacy BBCtrl/S70 trace remains outstanding.**
//! This was one of the R4 hardware-acquisition asks escalated for R6 (see
//!  and
//! ). The  handoff §7
//! ship-confidence table lists am3-bb at HIGH confidence, but no claim in this
//! module upgrades evidence-backed offline behavior into physical validation.
//! The sequence is reachable only through the explicit experimental
//! `--am3-bb-mining` route after exact platform admission; it is never invoked
//! by [`crate::platform::beaglebone::BeagleBonePlatform::new`].
//!
//! ## Status
//!
//! **EXPERIMENTAL: implemented from strong local evidence, not bench
//! validated.** The route is opt-in, instrumented, and fail-closed. Promotion
//! requires a physical AM335x BB run; the platform constructor does not
//! energize hardware or invoke this sequence.
//!
//! ## Phase map (matches R4 §1 timeline; W14.A1 phase-5 default-off)
//!
//! | Phase | t       | Action                                                       |
//! |------:|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | 1     | 7.8 s   | APW12 5-step PSU init via [`Apw12SmbusBackend`].             |
//! | 2     | 8.0 s   | PIC1704 DC-DC enable per chain (caller-provided).            |
//! | 3     | 8.0 s   | GPIO ASIC reset de-assert with 10 ms stagger.                |
//! | 4     | 8.5 s   | UART init (937500 baud) + soft-reset broadcast.              |
//! | 5     | 8.5 s   | MiscCtrl 0x00C100B0 triple-write — **OPT-IN, default OFF**.  |
//! | 6     | 9.5 s   | First WORK_TX dispatch readiness (LOG-ONLY on BB).           |
//!
//! ## Key differences vs CV1835 cold boot
//!
//! - **MiscCtrl triple-write is opt-in on AM335x.** W4 RE confirms BB
//!   bmminer binary contains no `0x00C100B0` or `miscctrl` string. Phase
//!   5 emits ZERO bytes when `opts.run_miscctrl_triple_write=false`
//!   (the default)..
//! - **NO FPGA bridge.** AM335x BBCtrl has no AXI-attached FPGA. ASIC
//!   work-dispatch goes through `/dev/uart_trans` (mmap kernel module),
//!   NOT through any FPGA register window. Phase 6 here is therefore
//!   LOG-ONLY — we do not dispatch real work, only assert the orchestrator
//!   reached the dispatch boundary. R4 confirms `/dev/axi_fpga_dev` on BB
//!   is for hash-board telemetry / fan PWM / temp sensors only, NOT chain
//!   work.
//! - **Sysfs GPIO is the shared captured-kernel API.** Stock Bitmain Linux
//!   3.8 predates `gpio-cdev`; live LuxOS Linux 5.4 retains sysfs. The current
//!   S19J_IO_BOARD_V2_0 route therefore uses pre-opened sysfs descriptors.
//!   A future character-device backend is additive only after its target
//!   images and raw-level semantics are independently validated.
//! - **No devmem pinmux replay.** CV1835 has 24× devmem writes in
//!   `S37bitmainer_setup`. AM335x relies entirely on the DTS for pinmux;
//!   no runtime replay is needed.
//! - **/etc/subtype gating.** AM335x BB carrier ships `BBCtrl_BHB42XXX`.
//!   PIC1704 routing is two-stage gated (subtype + 0x20 ACK probe) per
//!   .
//!
//! ## Reuse, never re-implement
//!
//! - PSU 5-step: `Apw12SmbusBackend::cold_boot_sequence_5_step` (W11.2).
//! - PIC1704 protocol: caller injects an impl of [`Pic1704ColdBoot`] backed
//!   by `dcentrald_asic::pic1704::Pic1704Service`. We can't depend on the
//!   asic crate from `dcentrald-hal` (cycle), so the trait abstracts the
//!   surface. Same trait shape as `cvitek_cold_boot::Pic1704ColdBoot`,
//!   but kept independent here so the marker types (Am335xBb vs Cv1835)
//!   can drift if the platforms ever need different surfaces.
//! - UART: [`crate::serial::DevmemUart`] (mirrors the CV1835 pattern). The
//!   R4 trace points at `/dev/ttyO%d` device names (omap-serial); the
//!   DevmemUart path lets the orchestrator force-set MCR=0x03 + FCR=0x07
//!   without trampling the kernel termios interface.
//!
//! ## Memory rules honored
//!
//! -  — heartbeat cadence is the
//!   caller's job; this module never extends past 2 s between ticks.
//! -  — caller's
//!   [`Pic1704ColdBoot`] impl MUST classify the version before `start_app`.
//!   The orchestrator calls `read_version` first per chain to assert the
//!   ordering at the orchestrator level too.
//! -  — `PsuGpioGate` ownership stays
//!   inside [`Apw12SmbusBackend`] / the caller's gate handle. We never
//!   manually `assert()` a gate from this orchestrator.
//! -  — phase 5 issues exactly
//!   3 writes with ≥ 5 ms spacing (asserted by tests).
//! -  — we never touch I²C
//!   addresses 0x50-0x57 (the caller's `Apw12SmbusBackend` is constructed
//!   on top of the platform's already-denylisted I2C service — see
//!   `beaglebone::BB_HASHBOARD_EEPROM_DENYLIST`).
//! -  — caller's PIC1704 adapter
//!   MUST be constructed only after `subtype` + `i2cdetect 0x20` both
//!   agree. This orchestrator trusts the trait surface; the gate lives at
//!   construction time, not here.

// ===========================================================================
//  S19J_IO_BOARD_V2_0 cold-boot — the `a lab unit`-class entry point (Phase B v1)
// ===========================================================================
//
// **This is a NEW entry point — the W4 `cold_boot_sequence` above is left
// untouched** (it targets a different IO board / stock-Bitmain BBCtrl; per
// Phase A's recommendation we do NOT edit it in place). The sequence below
// implements the v1 board-side init for `S19J_IO_BOARD_V2_0` from
//  §3-4:
//
//   1. consume the caller's pre-opened gpio59 owner and export/configure only
//      the ASIC RST gpios {49,60,27,22}
//   2. use that sole owner to assert gpio59 HIGH → settle (~3 s)
//   3. APW121215f init on the bit-banged i2c-gpio bus (bus 1) via the
//      7-byte UART-tunnel framing: probe HW=0x76/FW=0x17, calibration
//      read `0x06/[0x40,0x20]`, watchdog-disable `0x81/[0x00,0x00]` —
//      **NO PowerOn opcode** (rail comes up via gpio59)
//   4. APW set-voltage remains unresolved; chain rail is expected to be
//      controlled by the hashboard voltage path / board enable, not by this
//      APW tunnel helper. This step logs if the set-voltage stub is reached.
//   5. de-assert chain resets {49→60→27} with 10 ms stagger, retry chain1
//      with the ftrace-captured double pulse, leave gpio22/rst3 asserted
//      (chain 3 unpopulated), then settle ~1.1 s
//   6. (hand-off to the BM1362 chip-side init — the caller / Phase-C mode
//      does the enum / PLL / fast-baud / MiscCtrl / TicketMask / work dispatch via
//      `dcentrald-asic::bm1362` + the Phase-1 `uart_transport`; this
//      function returns once the board is powered + reset-released + the
//      UARTs are ready)
//   7. when requested in the same run (`apw_drop_to_steady`): APW drop
//      rail to ~13.8 V steady
//
// - NO PIC1704 DC-DC enable (`opts.enable_pic1704_dc_dc=false`) — NoPic board.
// - NO PIC heartbeat thread (`opts.run_pic_heartbeat=false`) — NoPic board.
// - MiscCtrl `0x18=0x00C100B0` triple-write is left to the chip-side init
//   (`opts.run_miscctrl_triple_write=true` is passed through to the BM1362
//   init, not done in this function).
//
// **Riskiest BEST-GUESS assumptions (Phase D resolves each):**
//   - gpio59 true-cold ON edge (HIGH=ON is consistent with luxminer
//     `active_low=false`, but not directly observed from AC-cold).
//     `// XXX: BEST-GUESS — verify on .79`
//   - the APW set-voltage payload encoding (centivolt vs raw vs DAC) — the
//     `ApwUartTunnel::set_voltage_mv` is a Phase-D stub, so step 4 here is
//     a LOG-ONLY placeholder when the stub returns its "not implemented"
//     error. `// XXX: BEST-GUESS — verify on .79`
//   - whether there's a PIC at 0x20/0x21/0x22 (assumed NoPic). If Phase D
//     finds one, this sequence grows a framed heartbeat (cold-boot-sequence.md §3 step 8).

///
/// # Arguments
///
/// - `_platform`: the BeagleBone platform (carries the loaded board-target;
///   currently the opts already pull everything from it, so this is here
///   for forward compat — a future wave may read the chain→tty map from it).
/// - `psu`: the APW121215f UART-tunnel PSU controller, pre-constructed by
///   the caller on the bit-banged i2c-gpio bus (bus 1) at 0x10.
/// - `uarts`: per-chain `DevmemUart`, one per `opts.chain_count` chain. The
///   caller opens these against `/dev/ttyS1` / `/dev/ttyS2` / `/dev/ttyS4`
///   first. (This v1 does NOT touch the UARTs — the chip-side BM1362 init
///   in `dcentrald-asic::bm1362` + the Phase-1 `uart_transport` owns them.
///   They're passed for shape-checking + forward compat.)
/// - `opts`: cold-boot options ([`ColdBootOptsV2`]).
///
/// # What it does
///
/// Steps 1-5 + 7 from the module banner above. Step 6 (BM1362 chip-side
/// init) is the caller's job — this function returns once the board is
/// powered + reset-released + the UARTs are ready. Step 7 (drop to steady)
/// only fires when `opts.apw_drop_to_steady` is `true` in the same cold-boot
/// run. Do not call this full GPIO sequence a second time just to drop the
/// rail; a higher-level caller should use the PSU interface directly after
/// chip-side init so ASIC resets are not asserted again.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// - `HalError::Platform(...)` for misshapen args (chain count vs uarts vs
///   `asic_rst_gpios`).
/// - Whatever the GPIO sysfs writes / the APW UART-tunnel calls return. The
///   APW set-voltage call is still a Phase-D stub in `psu_apw_uart_tunnel`; when
///   it returns its "not implemented" error, this function LOGS the failure and
///   continues. Calibration read and watchdog-disable are Ghidra-confirmed but
///   still treated as non-fatal by this `a lab unit` bring-up wrapper. The hard errors
///   are the GPIO writes and shape checks.
