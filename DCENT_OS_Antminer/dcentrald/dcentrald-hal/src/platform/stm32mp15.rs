//! STM32MP15 / Braiins BCB100 platform scaffold.
//!
//! BCB100 is a Braiins replacement control board for S19-family Antminers.
//! Public hardware docs establish the non-destructive platform identity:
//! STM32MP157-class SoC, 4 GB eMMC, microSD boot, four hashboard connectors,
//! four fan headers, and direct SoC I/O rather than a Bitmain FPGA.
//!
//! This module is intentionally conservative. The public files do not expose
//! a live-proved map for hashboard reset, plug detect, fan PWM/tach, PSU
//! control, or PIC bus ownership. Until a bench BCB100 probe captures those
//! facts, construction is gated behind `DCENT_BCB100_ACCEPT_UNVERIFIED=1`,
//! fan/GPIO control returns an error, and per-chain PIC addresses are unset.
//!
//! I2C discovery is also unavailable. The generic raw/service `ReadBytes`
//! paths select a slave with controller-affecting ioctl policy and may recover
//! an errored backend by dropping/reopening it; raw EEPROM reads additionally
//! depend on an unproven current pointer. None is a no-FORCE/no-recovery
//! observation contract. [`Platform::open_i2c`] therefore always refuses on
//! BCB100. The explicitly lab-gated serial passthrough is separate from this
//! I2C boundary and grants no I2C, GPIO, fan, PSU, or voltage authority.
