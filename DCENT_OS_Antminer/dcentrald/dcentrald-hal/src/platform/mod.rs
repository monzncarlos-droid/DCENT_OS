//! Platform trait and auto-detection.
//!
//! dcentrald supports multiple control board types through a platform trait.
//! Each platform provides its own implementation of chain access, I2C, fan
//! control, and GPIO. The initial implementation targets Zynq only.
//!
//! Platform auto-detection at startup:
//!   1. Check for UIO devices (/dev/uio0) -> Zynq
//!   2. Check for /dev/ttyO1 -> BeagleBone
//!   3. Check for STM32MP15 / ttySTM* -> Braiins BCB100
//!   4. Check for uart_trans kernel module -> CVitek
//!   5. Check for /dev/ttyS1 + Amlogic DTS -> Amlogic
