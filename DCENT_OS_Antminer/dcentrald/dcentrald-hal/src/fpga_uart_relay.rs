//! AM2 XIL `a lab unit` FPGA UART **return-relay** enable (`gpio@41220000`).
//!
//! ## What this is (LIVE-PINNED 2026-06-11)
//!
//! On the am2 Zynq S19j Pro, the chain command/response UARTs are PL
//! soft-16550 cores (`/dev/ttyS1` @ `0x41001000`, `/dev/ttyS3` @ `0x41021000`).
//! The BM1362 daisy-chain **RETURN** line (chip RO → chip-id/enum/nonce frames)
//! is NOT wired straight to the soft-UART RX pin — it is routed **through the
//! FPGA fabric**, gated by a 2-bit AXI-GPIO IP at physical `0x41220000`
//! (`gpio@41220000` in the device tree):
//!
//! - **bit 0 = `co_relay_en`** (Command-Output relay enable)
//! - **bit 1 = `ro_relay_en`** (Return-Output relay enable — the one that lets
//!   chip replies reach the host UART RX)
//!
//! This GPIO is the **only `/dev/mem` mapping bosminer makes** (RE-018 cold
//! strace: `mmap2(NULL, 65536, …, /dev/mem, 0x41220000)`). bosminer drives the
//! two bits HIGH (`DATA = 0x3`) as **outputs** (`TRI = 0x0`) during chain
//! bring-up — an mmap store that is invisible to strace, which is why six
//! months of RE never saw it.
//!
//! Important ambiguity: [`crate::psu_gpio_i2c`] also live-pins `0x41220000` as
//! the `gpio895/896` PSU SMBus AXI-GPIO bank. Treat this helper as a way to
//! match bosminer's observed low-bit GPIO state, not as proof that this bank is
//! solely or sufficiently a chain-return relay control.
//!
//! ## ⚠ THE NAME "UART RELAY" IS A MISNOMER — read this before chasing enum=0
//!
//! Adjudicated 2026-08-03 (W8, ) against `C2-CPLD-GLUE-LOGIC.md` §9
//! correction `C2-C6`. **The ambiguity above is resolved: this bank is the am2
//! PSU SMBus.** There is no UART-relay device behind these two pins. Three
//! independent first-party facts already in this tree say so:
//!
//! 1. **Live `a lab unit` measurement, 2026-05-23** (outranks any inference):
//!    `/sys/class/gpio/gpiochip895/label = /amba_pl/gpio@41220000`,
//!    `base=895 ngpio=2`, with `gpio895 = SDA` (bit 0) and `gpio896 = SCL`
//!    (bit 1) — [`crate::psu_gpio_i2c`], `AM2_PSU_SDA_BIT` / `AM2_PSU_SCL_BIT`.
//!    A 2-line bank cannot simultaneously be the SMBus pair and a separate
//!    relay pair.
//! 2. **Our own production guard already assumes it.** `s19j_hybrid_mining.rs`
//!    refuses to call this helper unless the dumb-PSU bypass owns the bus,
//!    stating outright that "the relay RMW drives gpio895/896 (PSU SMBus
//!    SDA/SCL)". A shipped fail-closed guard is a stronger statement of intent
//!    than a doc comment.
//! 3. **Braiins' own pin constraints agree** for the sibling am1-s9 fabric:
//!    `zynq-io-am1-s9-braiins/design/src/constrs/pin_assignment_xc7z007s.tcl:80-84`
//!    puts `iic_psu_scl_io` @ `F15` and `iic_psu_sda_io` @ `H14`, both
//!    `LVCMOS33 PULLUP true`. (Corroboration only — that is the am1 design.)
//!
//! So `DATA=0b11 / TRI=0b00` is **not** "enabling a relay". It parks a
//! bit-banged open-drain I²C pair driven high — the idle state an unused SMBus
//! should sit in, and byte-identical to where bosminer leaves it. That is
//! exactly consistent with the live v+2 result: matching the byte succeeded and
//! **enum stayed 0**.
//!
//! One thing the census got wrong and must not be copied: it is *not* true that
//! "there is no external device on the far side of these pins". On am2 the far
//! side is the **PSU SMBus peer** (the Loki spoof board / APW). What is absent
//! is a *UART relay*, not a device.
//!
//! **Why nothing is renamed.** `DCENT_AM2_FPGA_UART_RELAY_COLD`,
//! [`enable_am2_uart_relay_cold`], [`AM2_UART_RELAY_GPIO_BASE`],
//! [`UART_RELAY_ENABLE_BITS`] and
//! [`UartRelayEnableResult::relay_confirmed`] are on the live-exercised `a lab unit`
//! path, appear in shipped launcher scripts, and are pinned by name in
//! `dcentrald/tests/am2_class_gate_boundary.rs`. A rename here is **not inert**
//! and could break the fragile `a lab unit` recipe, so the identifiers stay and this
//! banner carries the correction instead. The bosminer-side name is real —
//! bosminer genuinely has a `UartRelayReg` and an `" Enabling UART relay chip: "`
//! string — our error was binding that concept to *this address*, which remains
//! unproven and is listed as stale in
//! :129-134`.
//!
//! Change **nothing** about `a lab unit` behaviour on the strength of this note.
//!
//! ## Why this was a plausible `a lab unit` standalone enum=0 root-cause
//!
//! The device-tree reset default for this GPIO is `tri-default = 0xffffffff`
//! (both bits **input/floating** ⇒ relay DISABLED). DCENT's `a lab unit` standalone
//! path drives the chain over the plain kernel `ttyS1`/`ttyS3` and **never
//! mapped this GPIO**, so on a cold boot the RETURN relay stayed open:
//! commands went out (UART TX drained, `lsr=0x60`) and **zero** bytes came
//! back (`rx_bytes_pre_init=0`, `unique_chip_replies=0`). The 2026-06-11 live
//! v+1 run proved every other layer GREEN (dsPIC `real_ack`, rail ~13 V, OUT2
//! asserted) with enum still 0, which made the open RETURN relay the top
//! candidate before v+2 falsified it as sufficient.
//!
//! ## Live falsification boundary (2026-06-11)
//!
//! The v+2 live run enabled this GPIO and read it back as byte-identical to the
//! bosminer-engaged state (`DATA=0x3`, `TRI=0x0`, `relay_confirmed=true`), but
//! enum was still 0 (`rx_bytes_pre_init=0`, `unique_chip_replies=0`) and the
//! board stayed cold / LM75 unavailable. So this helper is necessary to match
//! bosminer state, but not sufficient and must not be treated as the complete
//! root cause. The remaining discriminator is a bosminer-engaged vs
//! DCENT-standalone register diff, or chip-physical rail/clock proof.
//!
//! ## Live ground truth (2026-06-11, read-only probe on a bosminer-engaged `a lab unit`)
//!
//! ```text
//! devmem 0x41220000 32  →  0x00000003   (DATA: bit0 co_relay_en + bit1 ro_relay_en, BOTH SET)
//! devmem 0x41220004 32  →  0x00000000   (TRI : bits[1:0] = OUTPUT, driving)
//! ```
//!
//! Reconciliation with prior RE: the `miner-glitch-monitor` at `0x43d00000`
//! (see [`crate::glitch_monitor`]) is a **read-only diagnostic mirror** of
//! relay state — a DIFFERENT region that the Phase-9A live tests correctly
//! found rejects writes. The real control surface is this AXI-GPIO at
//! `0x41220000`. The 32-bit `UartRelayReg{gap_cnt,nonce_gap_en,ro/co_relay_en}`
//! struct in bosminer maps its low 2 bits onto this 2-bit GPIO; `gap_cnt` /
//! `nonce_gap_en` are vestigial for the relay-enable purpose on am2.
//!
//! ## Scope / safety
//!
//! This is a 2-bit GPIO config write — pure FPGA-fabric logic, no power/thermal
//! surface. The caller gates it `DCENT_AM2_FPGA_UART_RELAY_COLD=1` + `a lab unit`
//! fingerprint + NOT-handoff (`!DCENT_AM2_TRUST_RAIL_FALLBACK`). When that gate
//! is unset, the caller is a no-op. When the gate is set, the caller treats any
//! `/dev/mem`, mmap, or readback failure as fail-closed before enum. This helper
//! does NOT touch the dsPIC, the PSU, the chip rail, fans, or any EEPROM.
//!  handoff can inherit this GPIO from bosminer before `killall`, but the
//! v+2 run proved the relay alone does not wake the cold standalone path.
