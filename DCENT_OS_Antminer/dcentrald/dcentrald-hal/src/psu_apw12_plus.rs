//! Quarantined APW12+ register-model evidence plus framed-protocol builders.
//!
//! The original implementation associated this register model with S21,
//! S21 Pro, and S21 XP. Three later held-code sources refute that association:
//! they show GPIO enable plus `55 AA` framed traffic for the observed
//! APW121215a/f paths, not this register map. The register backend therefore
//! has no production constructor and grants no S21 PSU authority.
//!
//! Three PSU drivers coexist in `dcentrald-hal`. They are NOT
//! interchangeable — picking the wrong one will silently EIO at best and
//! corrupt PSU firmware state at worst:
//!
//! | Driver | Wire protocol | Platforms | Module |
//! |--------|----------------|-----------|--------|
//! | `Apw121215a` | `[55 AA LEN CMD ... SUM]` framed | Zynq am2 (S19 / S19j Pro / S19j XP) | [`crate::psu`] |
//! | `Apw12SmbusBackend` | SMBus opcode + payload (17 opcodes) | CV1835 / AM335x BB / Amlogic S19j Pro | [`crate::psu_apw12_smbus`] |
//! | `Apw12PlusBackend` | historical I2C register hypothesis | no admitted platform | THIS FILE (tests only) |
//!
//! The compared protocols use the same nominal slave address, which cannot
//! identify a wire protocol or platform. The historical backend has no
//! production constructor; exact platform classification alone must not
//! resurrect it.
