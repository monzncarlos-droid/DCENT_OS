//! am2 PSU bypass gate — the "Loki bypass" path for non-smart PSUs.
//!
//! When an am2 (Zynq) S19j Pro runs a *non-smart* PSU — e.g. an APW3 tweaked
//! to ~12.8 V via the "Loki Mod" — there is no APW121215a at I2C `0x10` to
//! probe, no watchdog to disable, no DAC to program. But the hardware power
//! gate is unchanged: the `PWR_CONTROL` line must still be asserted before the
//! hashboard rail comes up (the APW3 output enable is still wired through it on
//! a Loki-modded chassis, exactly like the stock APW12 was).
//!
//! `PsuBypassGate` is what the am2 hybrid cold-boot uses *instead of*
//! `Apw121215a` when `[power.psu_override].enabled` is set. It owns the same
//! `PWR_CONTROL` GPIO that `Apw121215a` would have owned (so there is exactly
//! one owner of that line — they are mutually exclusive on a given unit) and
//! records the operator-declared PSU model + input/rail voltage so the rest of
//! the daemon can report efficiency/power context. It performs **no** I2C.
//!
//! The declared rail voltage is the PSU output / hashboard-DC-DC *input*
//! (~12.8 V for the APW3 Loki Mod, ~15.2 V for a stock APW12). It is **not**
//! the per-chain chip-rail voltage that the hashboard dsPIC regulates to
//! (~13.7 V setpoint on am2) — that stays a separate `[mining].voltage_mv`
//! concern and is never derived from this value.
