//! Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for dcentrald.
//!
//! Provides safe Rust wrappers around Linux hardware interfaces used to
//! control Antminer hardware. This crate has NO dependencies on other
//! dcentrald crates -- it is pure hardware access.
//!
//! Modules:
//! - `uio`              - UIO device: open, mmap, IRQ wait (foundation of BraiinsOS FPGA access)
//! - `fpga_chain`       - BraiinsOS FPGA chain register blocks (common, cmd, work-rx, work-tx)
//! - `i2c`              - I2C bus: open /dev/i2c-N, ioctl, read/write
//! - `gpio`             - AXI GPIO: direct register access for plug detect + board reset
//! - `fan`              - Fan PWM controller (7-bit PWM, 7-bit tach)
//! - `watchdog`         - /dev/watchdog open, periodic kick
//! - `xadc`             - XADC IIO sysfs: die temp, VCCINT, VCCAUX
//! - `led`              - LED control via GPIO output register
//! - `platform`         - Platform trait and auto-detection (Zynq S9/S19, Amlogic, BeagleBone)
//! - `platform::config` - Runtime platform config (replaces hardcoded S9 constants)
//! - `serial`           - Standard Linux serial port with custom baud rate support
//! - `serial_chain`     - Serial-based chain transport (NS16550A UART backend for ASIC comms)
//! - `psu`              - APW PSU controller via I2C bus 1 (PMBus-like protocol, watchdog)
//! - `psu_apw12_smbus`  - APW12 SMBus opcode driver for CV1835/AM335x BB/Amlogic S19j Pro (NOT for Zynq am2 — that uses `psu::Apw121215a`)
//! - `psu_apw12_plus`   - APW12+ register-based PSU driver for S21 family (Amlogic, NoPic). DIFFERENT protocol from APW12 SMBus.
//! - `psu_apw_uart_tunnel` - APW121215f framed UART-tunnel driver for the AM335x BB S19j Pro on S19J_IO_BOARD_V2_0 (the `a lab unit` unit). DIFFERENT framing from `psu_apw12_smbus`. Frame format LIVE-CONFIRMED (2026-05-12 ftrace on `a lab unit`); calibration read + watchdog-disable opcodes Ghidra-confirmed (2026-05-31); set-voltage payload still TODO.
//! - `stock_fpga`       - Stock Bitmain FPGA register access (/dev/axi_fpga_dev, 352-byte flat space)
//! - `stock_fpga_iic`   - Stock FPGA PIC I2C via IIC_COMMAND register (no /dev/i2c-*)
//! - `stock_fpga_work`  - Stock FPGA DMA work dispatch + nonce FIFO (DHASH accelerator)
//! - `stock_fpga_axi_ioctl` - bitmain_axi.ko IOCTL adapter (DEV/DEBUG ONLY; gated behind `axi-ioctl-debug` Cargo feature per W13.B5; QEMU rehosting helper, NOT compiled into shipping firmware)
//! - `stock_fpga_axi_mmap`  - bitmain_axi.ko mmap adapter (production canonical per RE3 — `BitmainAxiMmapBackend` + `BitmainAxiUnifiedBackend`)
//! - `uio_discover`     - UIO device discovery by kernel-published name (shared by fan + FPGA chain backend)
//! - `chain_backend`    - `Bm1397PlusChainBackend` trait abstracting BM1362-family chain transport (PL UART vs FPGA FIFO)
//! - `fpga_chain_backend` - `FpgaChainBackend` impl of `Bm1397PlusChainBackend` over the FPGA FIFO IP blocks (am2 chain1 at 0x43C0Nxxx)
