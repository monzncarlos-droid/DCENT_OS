"""no-orphan-driver gate: fail when a pub PSU/regulator/PIC backend is unreachable.

Hardware-enablement constitution rank 36 (H4 #7), shipped 2026-08-03 (W8-B).

The recurring failure this prevents: a complete `pub` PSU/regulator/PIC backend
compiles, is unit-tested, and ships while having ZERO non-test construction
sites -- i.e. it is unreachable in production. `Apw12SmbusBackend` (~1,200
lines) and `Apw12PlusBackend` (~500 lines) both shipped that way; so did the
`PsuBackend` factory enum, `Pic1704Service`, and `PicController::flash_firmware`.
This is the type-level sibling of the memory rule
 (tests that
construct a backend directly cannot see that production never does).

What this gate checks, per `pub` struct/enum defined in the SCOPED power/PIC
modules:

1. TYPE CHECK -- construction-shaped evidence (`Type::assoc_fn(..)`,
   `Type::Variant(..)`, or a `Type { .. }` literal) must exist in at least one
   PRODUCTION position: not inside a `#[cfg(test)]` region, not in a `tests/`,
   `benches/`, or `examples/` tree, and not inside the type's own inherent
   `impl` block (self-construction inside an uncalled factory proves nothing).
2. METHOD CHECK -- for types that PASS the type check (live types), every
   `pub fn` in a production inherent-impl region must have at least one
   call-shaped use (`.name(` or `::name(`) somewhere in the workspace,
   test or production. Zero-anywhere = an orphan capability on a live type
   (the `flash_firmware` class).

3. SCOPE CHECK -- every entry in SCOPE_GLOBS must match at least one file.
   A scope entry that silently matches nothing is the same failure class this
   gate exists to catch, occurring inside the gate itself. Round-16 B6 found
   exactly that: `dcentrald-hal/src/voltage_rail_adapters.rs` had been listed
   as scope since 2026-08-03 while the real file lives in `dcentrald-asic/`,
   so two complete `pub` VoltageRail energization adapters (`DsPicVoltageRail`,
   `Pic1704VoltageRail`) were never scanned. A dead glob is now a FAIL.
4. REASON CHECK -- every TOLERATED_ORPHANS value must be a dated, substantive
   reason. An allowlist without reasons is what a future "generalisation" wave
   strips without noticing; blanking a reason must fail loudly, not pass.

Known limitations (deliberate; documented so nobody "fixes" them into noise):
- One-hop only. A production construction inside a function that is itself
  unreachable still passes (e.g. `psus.rs`'s catalog gained a production
  consumer in rank-35 `power_topology.rs` whose own consumers are test-only).
  Transitive reachability is the compiler's job, not a regex gate's; the
  allowlist ledger is where such chains are recorded.
- Method-name collisions across types. The METHOD CHECK matches `.name(` /
  `::name(` textually, so a method is treated as live when a DIFFERENT type's
  identically-named method is called. Live example: the daemon calls
  `CurtailmentController::enter_sleep`, which masks the fact that
  `ThermalController::enter_sleep` has no production caller either. Resolving
  this needs type resolution, not regex; where it matters, the allowlist row
  for the visible half records the masked half explicitly.
- Construction-shaped only. A type whose values are minted exclusively by
  derive-generated conversions (`thiserror` `#[from]`, `Into`, `?`) shows zero
  constructions. Such rows are adjudicated by reading the crate, not by
  loosening the regex.
- Scoped to `DCENT_OS_Antminer/dcentrald/`. The three 2026-07-30 ESP
  rail-enablement cases lived in `DCENT_OS_ESP/` and would need a
  sibling instance of this gate there.

Existing orphans are pinned in TOLERATED_ORPHANS below -- explicit, dated,
reasoned. The gate FAILS on any NEW orphan and also FAILS when an allowlist
entry stops being an orphan (stale ledger rows must be deleted in the same
change that wires the backend). NEVER silently exempt.
