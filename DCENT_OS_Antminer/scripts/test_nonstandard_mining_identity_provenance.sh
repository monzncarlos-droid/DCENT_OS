# Fail-closed audit for ASIC identity in mining engines that bypass Daemon.
#
# None of these engines currently retains a complete, generation-bound
# GetAddress receipt containing exact chain ID, enumerated chip count, and ASIC
# family for every active chain. They must therefore remain non-Measured:
#
# P0 serial_mining: generic family/geometry are resolved from model/config and
#    transient GetAddress observations are not promoted to Measured identity.
#    The exact native BM1366 owner separately requires its joined 77/77 receipt,
#    but still cannot mint the standard composition token audited below.
# P0 am3_bb_mining: GetAddress can retain CRC-verified repetitions of the one
#    captured BM1362 unassigned payload, but repetitions are not unique-chip or
#    chip-count evidence and the engine owns no composition generation. Address
#    assignment still uses catalog geometry. Trailer bits 6:5 remain opaque.
# P1 s19j_tap_mining: bosminer performed enumeration; dcentrald has no receipt.
# P1 stock_mining: read_chip_id() identifies the FPGA, and no per-chain ASIC
#    GetAddress result is retained.
#
# Promotion requires a typed, immutable receipt minted at successful response
# parsing plus a composition generation owned by that engine. Config, model,
# EEPROM, topology, non-zero RX, and a predecessor firmware are not substitutes.
