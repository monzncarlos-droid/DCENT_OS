EXPECTED_SAFETY_CLAMP_COUNT = 103
# G30: BM1368 ramp clamp site content/line drift after pure plan thin-wrap;
# classified count unchanged (91). Digest re-pin only.
# G42: BM1391 open-coded freq/25 clamp removed; pure-pin ban string replaces site.
# G43 (2026-08-03, hardware-enablement rank 44): 91 -> 92. ONE new classified
# clamp, `bm1485.rs:605` `target_mhz.clamp(100, 700)`, bounding the PLL divider
# SEARCH target in the new BM1485 (Antminer L3/L3+) Scaffold driver. It is a
# frequency clamp by pattern; it is NOT a live safety clamp — the driver's
# `init_chain`/`set_frequency`/`set_voltage`/`send_work` all return `Err` and it
# cannot energize. Bounds come from `bm1485.md:176-183`, not from a guess.
# Deliberately re-pinned rather than exempted: the manifest classifies by
# pattern, not by reachability, and carving out "unreachable" clamps would make
# the count depend on a judgement this gate cannot verify.
# G44 (2026-08-04, CI clippy-green pass): 92 -> 93. NO new clamp was introduced.
# `serial_mining.rs` already bounded the AM2 BM1362 PIC-heartbeat failure budget
# with `.max(1).min(AM2_BM1362_PIC_HEARTBEAT_MAX_FAILURES)`; clippy::manual_clamp
# flagged it and it was rewritten as `.clamp(1, ..)`, which is equivalent for this
# integer expression. The manifest matches on `.clamp(`, so the effect was to make
# an ALREADY-PRESENT bound VISIBLE to this gate for the first time — coverage went
# up, behaviour did not change. Re-pinned rather than exempted, for the same reason
# as G43: the manifest classifies by pattern, and hand-carving exceptions would put
# the count at the mercy of a judgement it cannot check.
# G45 (2026-08-06, hardware-enablement campaign): 93 -> 94. ONE new classified
# clamp, `bm1491.rs:202` `freq_mhz.clamp(50, 800)`, bounding the PLL divider
# SEARCH target in the BM1491 Scaffold driver. Same shape as G43's BM1485 case:
# a frequency clamp by pattern, NOT a live safety clamp — the driver's
# `init_chain`/`set_frequency`/`set_voltage`/`send_work` all return `Err` and it
# cannot energize (pinned by its own `init_chain_fails_closed` test).
# Re-pinned rather than exempted, for the same reason as G43/G44: the manifest
# classifies by pattern, not reachability, and carving out "unreachable" clamps
# would make the count depend on a judgement this gate cannot verify.
# G46 (2026-08-15/16 S19k + S9 SE desk wave): 94 -> 97. Three additional
# classified `.clamp(` sites in the tree-scanning walk (pattern, not a new
# live PWM/voltage actuator). Digest re-pin only; do not exempt.
# G47 (2026-08-17 S19k Track-1 leftover): 97 -> 102. Five additional
# classified `.clamp(` sites from the leftover Serial+BM1366 / thermal-Ready
# walk (pattern classification, including PWM-adjacent statements). Digest
# re-pin only; do not exempt.
# G48 (2026-08-19 offline-gate convergence): count remains 102. Commit
# 99f66c060f applied rustfmt to the existing WattTargetPid integral bound, so
# the fingerprint expanded from a continuation-line `.clamp(...)` to the same
# `(self.integral + error * self.dt).clamp(...)` expression. A frozen-tree
# comparison against the G47 pin found this as the sole fingerprint delta;
# category, call, lower/upper bounds, and behavior are unchanged. Digest
# re-pin only; do not exempt.
# G49 (2026-08-20 offline-gate convergence): count remains 102. Comparison
# against the retained  frozen tree found no added/removed classified
# site: the G48 WattTargetPid rustfmt expansion remains, and the existing
# `safe_pwm_clamp` fingerprint moved from `thermal` to the more accurate
# `fan_pwm` category after nearby documentation explicitly named PWM. The
# clamp call and bounds (`requested.clamp(low, high)`) are unchanged. Digest
# re-pin only; do not exempt.
# G50 (2026-08-27 S17 unlock armada convergence): 102 -> 103. ONE new
# classified clamp, `s17_hybrid_mining.rs:315`
# `raw.clamp(0.0, 255.0) as u8` inside `apw9_dac_from_centi_volts`, the APW9
# PSU DAC bound of the new BM1397 (S17 family) recipe (A1 §V3 stock
# `bitmain-voltage` -> DAC law; DAC=156 at 17.00 V, saturated 0/255 at the
# documented envelope edges). Voltage clamp by pattern; it is the deliberate
# fail-closed bound of a typed executor whose SET_VOLTAGE is deferred until 5
# stable PIC heartbeats. Re-pinned rather than exempted, for the same reason
# as G43/G45: the manifest classifies by pattern, not by reachability, and
# hand-carving exceptions would put the count at the mercy of a judgement it
# cannot check. Digest re-pin only; do not exempt.
#
# PROCESS NOTE (why this drifted silently): `bm1491.rs` was an UNTRACKED file,
# so `git diff HEAD -- '*.rs'` showed zero added `.clamp(` while this gate,
# which walks `source_root.rglob("*.rs")`, saw it immediately. A tree-scanning
# gate and an index diff look at different sets — check
# `git status --porcelain | grep '^??'` before concluding the gate is wrong.
