// The mining dispatcher is the core coordination loop that:
//   1. Receives Stratum jobs from the pool(s) (via channels from StratumClient(s))
//   2. Converts jobs into ASIC work (midstate computation, merkle root)
//   3. Sends work to the ASIC driver
//   4. Reads ASIC responses (nonces)
//   5. Validates nonces against pool difficulty
//   6. Submits valid shares back to the correct Stratum client (via channel)
//
// Supports hashrate splitting across up to 2 pools using a deficit-based
// scheduler (job-based alternation). The ASIC does not know or care which
// pool the work came from.
//
// Runs in a dedicated thread on ESP32-S3.
