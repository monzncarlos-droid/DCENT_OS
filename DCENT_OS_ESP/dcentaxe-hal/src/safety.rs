// frequency to the last-known-good point and clears the fit window.
//
// These two functions are the SINGLE place the retreat condition is computed,
// so the espidf-only `autotuner` wiring (which cannot host-compile) can never
// disagree with the host-tested decision. They are pure arithmetic — no I/O,
// no alloc — so the truth table is unit-tested on the host.
//
// They are intentionally NOT `const fn`: `f64::is_finite` is not const-stable on
// the esp Rust toolchain. Every other property matches this module's existing
// const-over-plain-integers style.
//
// SAFETY / DEFAULT-PRESERVING CONTRACT: a HW-error backoff only ever signals a
// retreat toward an already-proven last-known-good (freq/voltage that previously
// passed the autotuner's health gate). The caller MUST drive freq/voltage DOWN
// to that proven point — never up. This can never raise frequency, raise
// voltage, lower a fan/thermal limit, or change a magic constant; it only makes
// the converged point MORE conservative.
